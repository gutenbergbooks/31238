<h3>EARLY LIFE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of West Hartford lies about
three miles from the centre of Hartford
and is mainly grouped about two cross-roads,
one leading from the city west to
Farmington, the other, the village street,
following the line of the Connecticut River
and rambling from Bloomfield, the next
village north, to Newington and New Britain
on the south. The changes in the
place for the last hundred and fifty years
have not been great; the Farmington road,
to be sure, as it leaves Hartford, keeps a
city character and shows trim villas at intervals
nearly all the way to the village, but
the village has not moved to meet the city,
and its houses and one or two churches
and post-office have admitted new-comers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
so slowly that the general air of the place
can scarcely be different from what it was
in 1758, when Noah Webster was born
there, October 16. The house in which he
was born is still standing, about a mile from
the corners, on the road leading south; it
is upon a broad table-land, and the wide
fields which lie below it, stretching away
to Talcott Mountain, where the western
view ends, are the fields which Webster's
father planted.</p>

<p>The ancestral stock was substantial. Noah
Webster remembered the funeral of his
grandfather Daniel, and Daniel was five
years old when his grandfather died, who
was one of the first settlers in Hartford
and Governor of Connecticut. The family
had lived thus in this district for five generations,
as farmers, long lived and good citizens.
The place where Webster was born
was sold by his father in 1790 to the family
whose representatives now live there;
it covered eighty acres then, but has been
broken in upon from time to time. The senior
Webster sold it because he was poor. He
lived his life of ninety-one years in a Connecticut
village, leaving it only when he led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
a company for one campaign in the Revolutionary
War. His square, upright tombstone
stands in the village graveyard, and
commemorates the stocky virtues of integrity
and piety. He was Deacon Webster
and Squire Webster, and reached thus the
highest offices in state and church which a
little New England village could offer.</p>

<p>Upon the senior Webster's stone is the
name of his wife Mercy, who is comprehensively
disposed of as "his consort, equally
respected for her piety and virtues." She
was a descendant of William Bradford, the
Plymouth governor, and thus the two lives
which met in Noah Webster were Pilgrim
and Puritan, without, it appears, any quartering
from other sources. All the Websters
were a sturdy race. Noah Webster,
senior, died in his ninety-second year; Noah
the son in his eighty-fifth; his two brothers
lived for eighty years or more, and his two
sisters for seventy. Out of the scanty memoranda
of the family genealogy little more
is to be gleaned, but it is enough for our
purpose to know that the man, whose fortunes
we are to follow, inherited the Puritan
mind and the New England constitution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>He had, what every New England family
wished to give a boy who had any quickness
of intellect, the education that was at
the door. He worked on his father's farm
and went to the village school where rarely
a book was used except a spelling-book, a
psalter, a Testament or a Bible. When he
was fourteen years old he had shown that
he was of the college kind, and studying for
two years with Dr. Perkins, the village
minister, and in the Hopkins Grammar
School at Hartford, he entered Yale College
in 1774. There were about a hundred
and fifty students in New Haven at that
time, with a faculty consisting of a Professor
of Divinity, who performed the duties
of President, a Professor of Mathematics
and Natural Philosophy, and three tutors.
Joel Barlow was a classmate, and so were
Oliver Wolcott, Zephaniah Smith, Ashur
Miller, and others who occupied high judicial
positions afterward in the young republic.
In Dr. Stiles's Diary there is an
entry June 14, 1778, Webster's senior year.
"The students disputed forensically this
day a twofold question; whether the destruction
of the Alexandrian Library and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the ignorance of the Middle Ages, caused by
the inundation of the Goths and Vandals,
were events unfortunate to literature. They
disputed inimitably well, particularly Barlow,
Swift, and Webster."</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly felicitous
in this grave record. It was a rotund kind
of learning which was cherished by Dr.
Stiles and similar guardians of the old traditions
of scholarship, and in the absence
of much commerce with their intellectual
peers beyond the limits of the colonies,
each college made believe very hard that
its students were scholars, and its scholastic
life the counterpart of historic universities.
But it is easy to believe that the fate of the
Alexandrian Library and the performances
of the notorious Goths and Vandals, those
favorite and dimly understood barbarians,
had no such power in determining the education
of the young Yale student as had
the events of the war then going on. Webster
had entered college in the fall of 1774;
in the spring of 1775, while he was still a
Freshman, he had his little initiation into
Revolutionary society. General Washington
was on his way to Cambridge, to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
command of the American army, and with
him was General Charles Lee. They passed
through New Haven, and Webster has left
a little sketch of the scene.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen lodged in New Haven,
at the house of the late Isaac Beers, and in
the morning they were invited to see a military
company of students of Yale College
perform their manual exercises. They expressed
their surprise and gratification at
the precision with which the students performed
the customary exercises then in use.
This company then escorted the generals as
far as Neck Bridge, and this was the first
instance of that honor conferred on General
Washington in New England. It fell to
my humble lot to lead this company with
music."</p>

<p>The last sentence is a faint hint at an
amusing and pardonable little vanity of
Webster's, who, as the reader will discover
later, liked to think that he had a hand in
pretty much every important measure in
the political and literary history of the
country in those early days, and remembered
that when the great Washington appeared,
Webster was ready with the prelu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>sive
fife. The three years which followed
were years of excitement and distraction.
In the summer of 1777 the college life at New
Haven was broken up, and the classes were
disposed in various towns, the Junior class,
in which Webster belonged, being stationed
at Glastonbury and placed under the charge
of Tutor Buckminster. This was the time
when all New England, especially the southern
part, was thrown into a ferment by Burgoyne's
movements, and men were hurried
into the field to meet this army coming
down from the north. Webster's father
was captain in the alarm list, and Webster
shouldered his musket as a private in his
father's company. The episode was probably
in the summer vacation, and put a stop
to his work on the farm rather than to his
studies in college. Burgoyne's defeat released
the young volunteer, but an education
which was divided between the camp
and the cloister was pretty sure to be fruitful
in something beside scholastic learning.
A college, scattered as if by the enemy's
bombs into country villages, was likely to
think with all the eagerness of youth upon
questions of political ethics, and of the broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
grounds of human freedom. There are two
words often used in the ephemeral literature
of that day,&mdash;<i>slave</i>, <i>free</i>,&mdash;words used
somewhat recklessly at times, but marking
the general current of men's thoughts.</p>

<p>Webster, in one of his reminiscences, recalls
the wretched condition of affairs when
he was in college: "So impoverished was
the country at one time," he writes, "that
the steward of the college could not supply
the necessary provisions of the table, and
the students were compelled to return to
spend several months at home. At one
time goods were so scarce that the farmers
cut corn-stalks and crushed them in cider-mills,
and then boiled the juice down to a
syrup as a substitute for sugar." The years
which followed his graduation were, if anything,
still more discouraging. When he
went home, after Commencement, his father
gave him an eight-dollar bill of the Continental
currency, worth then about fifty cents
on the dollar, and left him to his own resources.
His plan was to study law, but his
first business was to maintain himself, and
he took up school-teaching, spending the
winter of 1778 in Glastonbury, where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
had gone with his class the year before. In
the summer of 1779 he returned to Hartford
and taught there, living in the family
of Mr., afterward Chief Justice, Oliver Ellsworth,
and picking up a little law. In the
hard winter of 1780 he taught in his native
village, and in the next summer he lived
with and assisted Jedediah Strong, register
of deeds in Litchfield, where he read law,
and then was admitted to the bar in Hartford.</p>

<p>There was, however, no business. People
were too poor to go to law, and the whole
country was depressed by its condition.
The struggle for independence had not been
a short, sharp one, marked by an intense
flame of enthusiasm; the end was reached
less by heroic endeavor than by heroic patience
and the wisdom of a few. The depths
of ignominy into which Continental currency
had sunk measured the hopelessness with
which those who lived by wits rather than
by manual labor surveyed the field. So, relinquishing
the law, Webster resumed teaching,
this time in Sharon. An advertisement
gives notice of what he expected to do in his
school:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the first of May will be opened, at
Sharon in Connecticut, a school, in which
children may be instructed, not only in the
common arts of reading, writing, and arithmetic,
but in any branch of academical literature.
The little regard that is paid to
the literary improvement of females, even
among people of rank and fortune, and the
general inattention to the grammatical purity
and elegance of our native language,
are faults in the education of youth that
more gentlemen have taken pains to censure
than correct. Any young gentlemen
and ladies, who wish to acquaint themselves
with the English language, geography, vocal
music, &amp;c., may be waited on at particular
hours for that purpose. The price of
board and tuition will be from six to nine
shillings lawful money per week, according
to the age and studies of the scholar; no
pains will be spared to render the school
useful.<span class="smcap floatright">Noah Webster.</span></p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sharon</span>, <i>April 16, 1782</i>.</p>

<p>"N. B. The subscriber has a large convenient
store in Sharon fit for storing articles
of any kind, where they may be secured
at a moderate expense."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>One would like to know if R&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash; was
one of the young ladies upon whom he
waited at some particular hour, for tradition
tells of the young teacher, with a commanding
figure and erect carriage, very
careful in dress and precise in speech, sparing
no pains not only to render the school
useful but himself agreeable to this young
lady, who found, however, a stronger attraction
in a soldier lover, soldiers having then,
as later, a singular advantage in such rivalries.
This precise-speaking young school-master
was ready enough for a frolic, as may
be guessed from two consecutive entries in
his brief diary, a little later:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Feb. 18, 1784.</i> At evening rode to
Wethersfield [from Hartford, where he was
then living] with the ladies, who reminded
us of the mile-stones and bridges." [Does
any one now need to be told why?]</p>

<p>"<i>Feb. 19</i>, <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> Rode to East Windsor;
had a clergyman with us, who sang an
excellent song. Mile-stones and bridges almost
totally neglected."</p>

<p>The demure mouth with which this last
sentence is spoken must have had a curl at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>the corner occasionally. While living at
Sharon he took the opportunity to study
French with a M. Tetard, a French Protestant
minister living in New Rochelle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the scanty records which remain I
have traced thus far Webster's early life and
education, but it is fair to find in his subsequent
career traces of the influence which
New England surroundings cast about every
New England boy. The simplicity of life
which characterized a province so uniform
in its character was especially evident in
the Connecticut Valley. Here, longer than
in the cities and on the sea-board, native
English and Puritan stock retained the
form and power which an unbroken succession
in blood and a freedom from external
pressure had made possible. The families
known by Webster in his boyhood, among
whom he lived, and whose lives passed into
his character, were a part of the great migration
which founded a new England between
1630 and 1640, and from a basis of
English law and custom, modified by theocratic
doctrines, and partially shaped by a
struggle with the wilderness, built a state
which was to be one of the great forces in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
American history. The agricultural life,
which was more productive in the valley of
the Connecticut than elsewhere, determined
largely the social life of the colony, made
Connecticut the most serenely democratic
of the New England States, emphasized the
individual worth, and allowed free play in
self-government. The church held its own
for a longer period than in Massachusetts;
the inevitable surrender of the ecclesiastical
power of the Congregationalists was
deferred until a much later date; and to-day
it is in Hartford that one will find
most distinctly the lines of colonial Congregationalism.</p>

<p>The life of the household in a Connecticut
village in the middle of the eighteenth century
was very self-centred. Remote from
towns,&mdash;for Hartford was only a village
then,&mdash;the demands of farming life determined
the round of days. Every one from
childhood fell of necessity into his or her
place as one of the workers, out doors and
in, and the simplicity of the social organization
made the farmer a mechanic as well.
There was the blacksmith's shop, where a
rudely trained skill supplied the more spe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>cial
needs; but the farmer himself not only
used his tools, but mended and to some extent
made them; he was carpenter also, and
shoemaker, and, in general, necessity had
taught his hands to shape and his fingers
to be dexterous. The boy made his own
traps and small tools and carts, and early
learned that handiness and adaptability
without which he would be likely to go
through life in a destitute condition. There
is to be found still, especially in the back
country, a curious survival of this old economy
in the hired man, who shines in literature
in the person of Mr. Jacob Abbott's
Jonas, the embodiment of practical wisdom,
learned not so much from books as from the
daily school of farm and shop life. The
hired man of that time was the occasional
unattached member of society, or one who
was forced out of the family hive by the
excess of hands and the deficiency of land.
Commonly the family itself supplied the
necessary laborers, and these all in their
youth, no matter what intellectual promise
they might give, were, as a matter of course,
parts of the regular farm company.</p>

<p>The jack-of-all-trades character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
farmer and the absence of a force of artisans
and special craftsmen easily compelled
a state of mutual dependence. If a house
or a barn were to be built, the neighborhood
was called in at the critical moment
to raise the frame; and the farmer who
asked the help made his acknowledgment
not only by serving when his neighbor
needed him, but by acting as host to the
company, and making the raising a time of
good cheer and hilarity. Harvest also gave
opportunity for mutual help and neighborly
charity, so that much of the social life of
the day grew naturally out of the common
work and occupation of the community.
In-doors it was the same, and quilting bees
and huskings and spinning bees made work
and play shade into each other. A community
where every one worked and each
might be needed by his neighbor would
scarcely suffer very marked distinctions of
rank; and in the lighter social life, which
made no pretense of work, the sleighing
parties and athletic sports, the suppers and
dances which followed the bees, an equality
of condition was assumed, very favorable to
self-respect and independence of judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
It is to be noticed that the substitution of
alphabetical order in college classes for a
rank based upon social distinction occurred
earlier at Yale than at Harvard, and it is
not unlikely that the more democratic life
of Connecticut had something to do with it.</p>

<p>Distinctions, however, there were, but
they were laid chiefly in reasons which all
were willing to accept. The magistrate
and the clergyman, though familiar associates
of the plainer people, were conceded a
deference which superior education, and not
superior birth, compelled, and without question
the road to eminence was held to lie
through education. No one dreamed of
securing the special honor of the community
except by this means, and in every family
a boy who showed intellectual promise
was encouraged to hope for a college education.
His college education was in most
cases expected to result in an entrance to
the clerical profession, but the law had by
this time begun to have a more distinct
claim upon attention, and the medical profession
had always demanded those who
could show a positive predilection for it.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
doctor, however, did not learn his science
under any organized educational system,
but by personal association and study
with an older practitioner, a system which
naturally lessened the likelihood of persons
drifting into the profession upon slight
grounds of preference. The self-contained
life of the community, indeed, made people
somewhat indifferent to a highly educated
medical profession, and increased also
the confidence with which any one might
assume to observe and discuss facts connected
with the art and science of healing.
In every household there was traditional
learning which served for ordinary purposes,
and the housewife knew and used
herbs with something of the practical wisdom
which she applied to her cooking. In
every community there was likely to be one
woman or more to whom the rest turned in
emergencies, and a rude practice was kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>up which cannot be called quackery, for it
was entirely unpretentious. Something also
was due to the knowledge derived from the
Indians, whose closeness to nature was supposed
to give them excellent opportunities
for wresting secrets from simples. This respect
for the Indian school survives still,
and affords a support to the queer practitioners
who call themselves Indian Doctors.
It was never strange, therefore, when a man
who had received a liberal education turned
his attention to questions which nowadays
a layman would scarcely venture to discuss.
He was not regarded as an amateur, but as
occupying himself with a legitimate part of
his business.</p>

<p>Even more surely was the educated man
a lawyer. There was always a good deal of
litigation going on in Connecticut, but the
legal profession scarcely existed as a distinct
body until Webster himself came upon the
stage. Plaintiff and defendant addressed
the court if they desired, and in the loose
practice of the day there were no intricate
and technical processes which debarred any
intelligent man from taking part in a cause.
Substantial justice was done, and every citi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>zen
took part in legal affairs with confidence
that he only needed perseverance and a fair
cause to achieve success. Above all, the
constant and familiar participation in public
concerns was a school for the citizen, in
which he learned thoroughly the art of legislation,
and acquired a readiness in government
which stood him in good stead when
the scope of governmental power was enlarged.
The New England town was always
the centre of political life, and each
member of the town learned early his inalienable
right to a participation in all the
benefits which the community could confer.
In town-meeting he learned to vote and to
be voted for; a gradation of offices from
fence-viewer or hog-reeve to selectman gave
training in administration to all who had
any capacity for organization or leadership;
the discussion of town affairs sharpened the
wits, and, better still, educated the towns-man
in a distinct recognition of his political
relations; he learned to think politically,
and as the Revolution drew near, the petty
interests of the local community widened
into larger questions of state when the towns
themselves found that they were parts of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
larger body corporate. Then the principle
of representation was constantly delocalizing
the town, and bringing into the arena
subjects which reminded men of their relationship
to the state and the crown. Men
who had grown up under the discussion
of questions which involved great historic
processes were not likely, when the occasion
came, to hold back from writing or
speaking on great national themes, merely
because they were not publicists by profession.</p>

<p>The military system, which formed so important
a part of the New Englander's education,
added to the picturesqueness of his
life and to the notion of solidarity. The
experience with Indian and Frenchman, as
has often been shown, had made the unostentatious
farmer-soldiers of New England
a formidable and resolute body when the
day of the Revolution came. Before that
day the train-bands of the towns were the
color and music of the otherwise monotonous
life. Four times a year came muster
with its drill, its competitive shooting, its
feasting, its sports, and its exercise of self-government
in the election of officers. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
visible expression of the power of the community
generated a self-confidence and a
spirit of generous comradery in the mind
of the young soldier; the courage which it
gave, the habit of standing upright in any
presence, the belief that back of the voice
lay the strong arm, were parts of the education
of such men as Webster.</p>

<p>Of the more specific literary education I
have already spoken. Webster's training
as a scholar was that of other Americans of
his day, neither better nor worse; and indeed
there was not much to choose between
the chances of town and country. So late
as 1813 Mr. George Ticknor, in his reminiscences,
relates his difficulties in undertaking
the study of German in Boston: "At
Jamaica Plains there was a Dr. Brosius, a
native of Strasburg, who gave instruction
in mathematics. He was willing to do what
he could for me in German, but he warned
me that his pronunciation was very bad, as
was that of all Alsace, which had become a
part of France. Nor was it possible to get
books. I borrowed a Meidinger's grammar,
French and German, from my friend Mr.
Everett, and sent to New Hampshire, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I knew there was a German dictionary, and
procured it. I also obtained a copy of
Goethe's 'Werther' in German (through
Mr. William S. Shaw's connivance) from
amongst Mr. J. Q. Adams's books, deposited
by him, on going to Europe, in the Athen&aelig;um,
under Mr. Shaw's care, but without
giving him permission to lend them."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Mr.
Hillard, in commenting on this, says well
that "there are now, doubtless, more facilities
in New England for the study of Arabic
or Persian than there were then for the
study of German." But it was not yet even
1813 in Hartford and its neighborhood, and
in the middle of the eighteenth century the
literary resources were meagre in the extreme.
Learning was not concentrated in
the towns, but the access to books there was
easier. The country minister, who was the
scholar, literary man, and school-master,
fell back largely upon the Greek and Latin
classics, and upon the few books of the day
which he could get in his rare journeys to
Boston. In Boston itself there were book-stores,
and John Mein, afterward a royalist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
refugee, kept a circulating library in 1765
at what was known as the London bookstore.
It numbered some twelve hundred
volumes, and boasted a printed catalogue.
It gives some indication of the condition
of the book business in Boston that he advertised,
about ten years before the out-break
of the war, a stock of above ten
thousand volumes. If Dr. Perkins, Noah
Webster's school-master, went to New Haven
to draw books from the college library,
he found there in 1765 "a good library,
consisting of about four thousand volumes,
well furnished with ancient authors, such
as the Fathers, Historians, and Classics;
many modern valuable books of divinity,
history, philosophy, and mathematics; but
not many authors who have wrote within
these thirty years."[3]</p>

<p>We are more concerned to know the
kind of reading which was at Webster's
command when a boy outside of his school
hours. That the severer literature dominated
seems evident from the recourse which
he has to it in his writings when he wishes
illustrations; for, like others of his day, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
classic authors, especially of Rome, were
quoted with a sense of their being final
authority. The newspaper in Webster's
youth had scarcely yet asserted itself very
forcibly. The few centres of population
had journals, which did not travel very far
beyond the place of publication. The Connecticut
"Courant," a weekly newspaper,
was started in Hartford in 1764, and was
of the better class, poorly printed, but serving
as a medium for communications from
its readers; the leading article was anticipated
by the letter to the editor or printer,
and with the exception of a scanty abstract
of news the "Courant" may be said
to have been edited by its subscribers,&mdash;a
policy which made such papers very good
reflections of the feeling of the community.
Older and better established than the newspaper
was the almanac, which throve in New
England and performed a familiar service in
every household. Mr. Ames or Mr. Lord,
and their fellows, addressed readers in the
jaunty, unconventional style which was regarded
as appropriate to a class of literature
which was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl,
and after their preliminary talk and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
monthly calendar, with its wonderful comments,
gave the page or two that remained
to anecdotes, poetry, and miscellaneous literature.
The calendar was headed by verse,
which was taken usually from English authors
of the time, and sometimes was treated
serially. Thus in one almanac the poem of
"Porsenna in pursuit of the Kingdom of
Felicity" trails along the head of the twelve
months, and at the end is announced to be
continued next year; next year it starts on
its journey again, and overflows upon one of
the extra pages, but still is unfinished; a
third year it makes a desperate effort to come
to an end, but the editor is obliged to announce,
"Conclusion omitted this year for
want of room;" and only when a fourth
year has come is he able to get rid of this
continued poem. Think of the impatience
of readers who had to wait from year to
year for four years before they could finish
reading this work of art! As the years
of the war drew near, the contents of these
little books took on a more martial character,
and the poetical <i>feuilleton</i> gave place
to a military chronicle.</p>

<p>Jejune enough do these hints seem to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
make the life in which Webster grew up:
but if it was poverty-stricken as compared
with the abundant resources of our own
day,&mdash;if the Hartford of 1765 is to be contrasted
with that of 1881, to the manifest
disadvantage of the former,&mdash;one would
wish to remember that in the very sterility
of that life there was a certain iron which
entered into the constitution of the people
who lived it. If there were not the leisure
and culture of the present day, neither were
there the mental indolence and dissipation.
Ames's Almanac was a joyless sort of light
literature, but at least it did not reduce intellectual
recreation to a mere frivolous indulgence
of the mental faculties. A fine
picture could be drawn of Webster on the
one side, extracting what juice he could
from the chippy leaves of the almanac and
"Courant," and of a youth of this year,
entering a public library with his card, and
having the range of a hundred thousand
volumes; but the real comparison is to be
made between the results in character and
production. We are painfully familiar with
the lists of books which constitute the reading
of the average boy of to-day, and know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
perfectly well that they are very often narcotic
and stimulant. The reading which
was had with such difficulty in the middle
of the eighteenth century may sometimes
have acted as a sedative, but it was by
reason of quality and scarcity more generally
brave food; in the mind of the reader
there was an immense respect for literature
which induced a genuine hunger for books,
and the individuality of one who had intellectual
tastes was not impaired, as so often
happens now, but fortified and enriched.</p>

<p>The farm, the social round, the school,
the college, the out-door sports, the in-door
books and papers, were all parts of the circumstance
which affected the life of the
youth, but no picture of the time would
be complete which omitted the influence
upon him of the church. He would grow
up with the impression that the meeting-house
was the principal building in town,
the minister the principal person, and Sunday
the principal day. A curious illustration
of the strong hold which the religious
observance of Sunday had upon the colonists
then is in the construction of what
were known as Sabbath-Day Houses, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
I think were peculiar to Connecticut. At
any rate, there is so good a description of
them by a son-in-law of Webster's that I
give it here:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These houses were from twenty to
twenty-five feet in length, and from ten
to twelve feet in breadth, and one story
high, with a chimney in the middle, dividing
the whole space into two rooms, with a
partition between them, for the accommodation
of two families, who united in building
the house. The furniture consisted of
a few chairs, a table, plates and dishes,
some iron utensil, it may be, for warming
food which had been cooked. Besides the
Bible, there was sometimes a book on experimental
religion, like Baxter's 'Saints'
Rest,' or Allein's 'Alarm.' On the morning
of the Sabbath the mother of the family,
with provident care, put up her store of
comforts for the dinner, substantial or slight
fare as most convenient, a bottle of cider
almost of course. The family then set off
from their home in a large two-horse sleigh,
or on saddles and pillions. They stopped
at the Sabbath-day house, kindled a blazing
fire, and then went forth to shiver in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the cold during the morning services. At
noon they hurried back to their warm room.
After they had taken their meal, and by
turns drunk from the pewter mug, thanks
were returned. Then the sermon came
under review, from the notes taken by the
father of the family, or a chapter was read
from the Bible, or a paragraph from some
favorite author, the service concluding with
prayer or singing. After again visiting
the sanctuary, the family would return to
the Sabbath-day house, if the cold was severe,
before they sought their home. The
fire was then extinguished, the door was
locked, and the house remained undisturbed
during the week. In time the custom of repairing
to these houses changed; the houses
themselves became dilapidated, or furnished
a refuge for the poor. They were better
suited to those times, when so much was
thought of private family religion, than they
would be to ours, when religion has become
more of a public and social concern. The
last Sabbath-day house which I remember
stood on the land owned by the first minister.
It was occupied by John King, a Hessian
deserter from the British army. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
was owned by one of the Nortons. The
present writer can recollect as many as half
a dozen of these houses."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The legislation thrown about the Sabbath
was in confirmation of the public opinion
regarding its sanctity. The harsher
aspects of this observance have been sufficiently
dwelt upon in our histories; the effect
upon character has been less considered,
but the elevation of one day out of the tyranny
of work, the resolute facing of eternal
mysteries, and the withdrawal into a half-brooding,
half-active state of mind must
have had a powerful effect upon the imagination
and conscience. The meeting-house
was no holy building, but the Sabbath day
was a holy day, and was the most comprehensive
symbol of the Puritan faith. It
was what the altar is in the Catholic Church,
the holy of holies, about which the whole
movement of religious worship gathered.
Whatever disturbed the profound stillness
of the day was seized upon by the law as
sacrilegious; and never, perhaps, has there
been a religion which succeeded so com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>pletely
in investing time with the sacredness
which elsewhere had been appropriated
by place. Even the approach to the Sabbath
was guarded, and the custom of the
observance of Saturday evening appears to
have been derived from the backward influence
of the day, as the release upon Sunday
evening appears to have been a concession
to the flesh, which would otherwise have
rebelled. Dr. Bushnell, in his "Age of
Homespun," tells of his own experience in
boyhood, when he was refused a load of apples,
which he had gone to buy on Saturday
afternoon, because the farmer, on consulting
the sun, decided that he could not measure
out the fruit before the strict Sabbath began.</p>

<p>The minister again represented to the
young New Englander the highest expression
of human attainment. He was righteous
and he was learned. Learning he had
in a severe and lofty form, and though there
was little in his outward dress to mark him
as a priest of God, he was isolated from the
community by his authority and profession,
so that he answered rather to one's conception
of a prophet. Before him were brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
offenders against Sabbath decorum, and the
minister's study was to the boy the most
awful room into which he could enter. This
association of learning with piety served to
heighten still further the respect with which
learning was regarded, and to separate the
young student almost by a special laying on
of hands. The minister also usually had
his glebe, and held a common interest with
the farmers of the neighborhood,&mdash;a humanizing
relation which had much to do in
preserving the real respect in which he was
held. The positive influence of religion
upon life, by being identified with the highest
intellectualism and the most eminent
persons, had thus both its strength and
weakness. There was wanting the large
and comprehensive spirit of an historic
church; there was the peril of a too abstract
regard for religion; but on the other
hand there was a very strong stimulus to
individualism. No one with any force of
character could grow up under these influences
without being vigorously affected by
them.</p>

<h3>THE GRAMMATICAL INSTITUTE.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1782, while the American
army was lying on the bank of the Hudson,
I kept a classical school in Goshen, Orange
County, State of New York. I there compiled
two small elementary books for teaching
the English language. The country was
then impoverished, intercourse with Great
Britain was interrupted, school-books were
scarce and hardly attainable, and there was
no certain prospect of peace."</p>

<p>These words have doubtless a familiar
sound to the reader. They form the phrases
which Webster never wearied of repeating,
and whenever he had occasion to refer to
the beginning of his literary career he fell
naturally into this paragraph. It became a
formula for the expression of a fact which
was embedded in his mind as a stone marking
a point of departure. There is a consciousness
in it of the beginning of a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
enterprise, and certainly, when one considers
the immense stream which has flowed
from this little rill, he may seriously stand
and gaze at the young school-master and
his two small elementary books. The modesty
of the statement agrees with the size
of the books, but not with the expansiveness
of the composite title. The work projected
by Webster was "A Grammatical
Institute of the English Language, comprising
an Easy, Concise, and Systematic
Method of Education, designed for the Use
of English Schools in America." The "Institute"
was to be in three parts, which
were, in brief, a speller, a grammar, and a
reader. The formal and dignified title of
the work was the tribute which Webster
paid to old-fashioned scholarship; and it
is curious to see the evolution by which
it finally became the well-known "Elementary."
One or two ideas were working
their way out in Webster's mind. In
the first place he did not like the book
generally in use, "Dilworth's New Guide
to the English Tongue;" then he saw with
more or less clearness that, in the separation
from England that was fast taking place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the people in America must necessarily have
their own school-books, and his mind ran
forward even to a belief in a distinct and
separate literature and a considerable difference
in language. Yet at this time I am
not sure that he appreciated the pregnant
truth, so familiar to us now, of a vital connection
between popular education and popular
sovereignty. He began to see it, and
was influenced by it; but his work was
mightier than he then knew, for he had not
been educated in a free republic.</p>

<p>How simple and slight a change in methods
of text-books marks the introduction of
Webster's spelling-book, from which millions
of Americans have learned to spell the
names on a ballot! Lay Dilworth and a
first Webster side by side: the likeness and
the difference of the two are apparent. It
is clear that Dilworth served as a model,
and that Webster's book started simply as
an improvement upon the English original.
Even in externals there is a similarity.
The early editions of Webster had a
dim, hacked-out engraving on wood of Noah
Webster, Jr., Esq., to correspond with the
scarcely more refined portrait of Tho. Dil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>worth
which prefaces the "New Guide."
Both books have long lists of words, proceeding
from the simplest combination to
words of five syllables, and even in Dilworth
to proper names of six syllables, containing
such retired words as Abelbethmaacah; but
in Webster these lists proceed upon a regular
gradation of pronunciation, while in Dilworth
they follow such confusing and arbitrary
order as is indicated by the heading,
"Words of five, six, etc., letters, viz.: two
vowels and the rest consonants; the latter
vowel serving only to lengthen the sound
of the former, except where it is otherwise
marked," which is nearly as luminous as a
direction in knitting. Each offers illustrated
fables as reading lessons, and shorter sentences
are provided for first lessons in reading.
In Dilworth these are, without exception,
taken from the Psalms, or made up
to order to look like apocryphal psalms; in
Webster there is a suggestive divergence,
for while, as in Dilworth, the first sentence
is, "No man may put off the law of God,"
it takes a very few pages for the child to
reach the very practical passage, "As for
those boys and girls that mind not their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
books, and love not church and school, but
play with such as tell tales, tell lies, curse,
swear, and steal, they will come to some
bad end, and must be whipt till they mend
their ways." The child brought up on Dilworth
is practiced until nearly the last page
of the work upon the lesson of the first sentence,
with variations. Other differences
would be suggested at once by the use of
the two books. In Dilworth the child learns
all manner of English proper names and abbreviations
likely to be of use, such as Ldp.,
Bp., Rt. Wpful, Rt. Honble, Ast. P.G.C.
and P.M.G.C., the last two standing, as
the reader has of course already guessed,
for Astronomy Professor of Gresham College,
and Professor of Music at Gresham College,
which we politely take to have been
Tho. Dilworth's Alma Mater. In a note
at the foot of the column, T. D. adds: "It
argues a disrespect and slighting to use contractions
to our betters." The character
of this torture of the innocent was probably
determined by the use for which it was
intended in England, as indicated by Mr.
Dilworth's dedication "To the Reverend
and Worthy Promoters of the several Charity
Schools in Great Britain and Ireland."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster's Institute, on the other hand,
was plainly meant for the farmer boys and
girls of his country. "The spelling-book,"
he says in one of his essays, "does more to
form the language of a nation than all other
books," and the man who first supplied our
young nation with a spelling-book has undoubtedly
affected its spelling habits more
than any other single person. But Webster
was a moralist and a philosopher as well
as a speller. He was by no means restricted
in his ambition to the teaching of correct
spelling; he aimed to have a hand in the
moulding of the national mind and the national
manners. In his preface to "The
American Spelling-Book," he says: "To
diffuse an uniformity and purity of language
in America, to destroy the provincial
prejudices that originate in the trifling differences
of dialect and produce reciprocal
ridicule, to promote the interest of literature
and the harmony of the United States,
is the most earnest wish of the author, and
it is his highest ambition to deserve the approbation
and encouragement of his countrymen."
His spelling-book, accordingly,
in its early editions contained a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
sharp little warnings in the form of footnotes,
which imply that he seized the young
nation just in time to prevent the perpetuation
of vulgar errors, since these, if they
once became universal, would have compelled
the hereditary Webster to make
them the basis of orthoepic canons. Thus,
<i>ax</i> is reprobated when <i>ask</i> is intended;
Americans were to say <i>wainscot</i>, not <i>winch-cott</i>;
<i>resin</i>, not <i>rozum</i>; <i>chimney</i>, not <i>chimbly</i>;
<i>confiscate</i>, not <i>confisticate</i>. Since these
warnings disappeared after a few years it
may be presumed that he regarded the immediate
danger as passed; but the more substantial
matters of good morals came to
have greater prominence, and in addition
to the columns of classified words, which
constitute almost the sole contents of the
earliest edition, there came to be inserted
those fables and moral and industrial injunctions,
with sly reminders of the virtue
of Washington, which have sunk into the
soft minds of generations of Americans.
There was a Federal catechism, and a good
deal of geographical knowledge regarding
counties and county towns, to be taken economically
in the form of spelling lessons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
The successive editions became way-marks
of the progress of the nation, and so important
did the book rapidly become that
though its compiler was fast throwing off
the bondage of Anglican spelling, he never
dared to make the book conform to his
own principles; venturing only to hint in
his preface at the orthographic reform which
he longed to make. "The spelling," he
says, "of such words as publick, favour,
neighbour, head, prove, phlegm, his, give,
debt, rough, well, instead of the more natural
and easy method: public, favor, nabor,
hed, proov, flem, hiz, giv, det, ruf, wel, has
the plea of antiquity in its favor; and yet
I am convinced that common sense and convenience
will sooner or later get the better
of the present absurd practice."</p>

<p>The pictures which came to bring art as
an adjunct in impressing the young mind
were of the order already familiar in the
New England Primer, ingenuous in their
simple straightforwardness and of uncompromising
faithfulness to nature. The fable
of the Boy that stole Apples, which I have
never been able to trace back of Webster,
but through him has become a part of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
mental furniture, is briskly set forth at one
of its points in a queer wood-cut. The old
man in his continental coat has only gone
as far as words, and the boy is just reaching
out his arm for the round apple near him.
If another picture had been given, the old
man's coat would have been off and that
boy would have been seen slithering down
the trunk of the tree; and in the third
fable of the Fox and the Swallow there is a
phalanx-like arrangement of the tormenting
flies which appeals strongly to the imagination.</p>

<p>The second part of a Grammatical Institute
was a grammar,&mdash;"a plain and comprehensive
grammar founded on the true
principles and idioms of the language."
Webster had fallen upon Lowth's "Short
Introduction to the English Grammar," and
upon the basis of that book drew up his
grammar for the use of American youth.
But the principal result of his work seems
to have been the introduction of his own
mind to the study. Six years afterward
he wrote: "The favorable reception of this
prompted me to extend my original plan,
which led to a further investigation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
principles of language. After all my reading
and observation for the course of ten
years I have been able to unlearn a considerable
part of what I learnt in early life,
and at thirty years of age can with confidence
affirm that our modern grammars
have done much more hurt than good. The
authors have labored to prove what is obviously
absurd, namely, that our language
is not made right; and in pursuance of this
idea have tried to make it over again, and
persuade the English to speak by Latin
rules, or by arbitrary rules of their own.
Hence they have rejected many phrases of
pure English, and substituted those which
are neither English nor sense. Writers and
grammarians have attempted for centuries
to introduce a subjunctive mode into English,
yet without effect; the language requires
none distinct from the indicative;
and therefore a subjunctive form stands in
books only as a singularity, and people in
practice pay no regard to it. The people
are right, and a critical investigation of the
subject warrants me in saying that common
practice, even among the unlearned,
is generally defensible on the principles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
analogy and the structure of the language,
and that very few of the alterations recommended
by Lowth and his followers can be
vindicated on any better principle than some
Latin rule or his own private opinion."</p>

<p>Accordingly, besides publishing some dissertations
on the subject, he issued a new
grammar in 1807, based this time on Horne
Tooke's Diversions of Purley, an author
with whom Webster would naturally be in
sympathy. This grammar never had a firm
hold of the public, and was subsequently
incorporated into the prefatory matter of
his great dictionary, where he says: "My researches
into the structure of language had
convinced me that some of Lowth's principles
are erroneous and that my own grammar
wanted material corrections. In consequence
of this conviction, believing it to
be immoral to publish what appeared to be
false rules and principles, I determined to
suppress my grammar, and actually did so."</p>

<p>Here we have his frankness of character,
his honesty, his force of will, and the impulsiveness
with which he took up attractive
theories. Perhaps the most comprehensive
statement of his ruling principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is that he was governed by usage, but did
not sufficiently discriminate between usage
by educated and usage by uneducated people;
he had, indeed, so violent a prejudice
against grammarians in general, and so much
respect for popular instinct, that it was a
recommendation to him when a phrase was
condemned by the grammarians, while in
common use by the people. For example
he says in a Letter to the Governors, Instructors,
and Trustees of the Universities
and other Seminaries of Learning in the
United States, "According to the grammars,
the pronoun <i>you</i>, being originally
plural, must always be followed by a plural
verb, though referring to a single person.
This is not correct, for the moment
the word is generally used to denote an individual,
it is to be considered as a pronoun
in the singular number, the following verb
should be regulated by that circumstance
and considered as in the singular.... Indeed,
in the substantive verb, the word has
taken the singular form of the verb, <i>you
was</i>, which practice is getting the better of
old rules and probably will be established."
But old rules have considerable vitality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and the general opinion still is that if an individual
permits himself to be represented
by a plural pronoun he must accept all the
grammatical consequences. "I will even
venture to assert," he continues in the same
letter, "that two thirds of all the corruptions
in our language have been introduced
by <i>learned</i> grammarians, who, from a species
of pedantry acquired in schools, and
from a real ignorance of the original principle
of the English tongue, have been for
ages attempting to correct what they have
supposed <i>vulgar errors</i>, but which are in
fact <i>established analogies</i>.... In this country
it is desirable that inquiries should be
free, and opinions unshackled. North America
is destined to be the seat of a people
more numerous probably than any nation
now existing with the same vernacular language,
unless one except some Asiatic nations.
It would be little honorable to the
founders of a great empire to be hurried
prematurely into errors and corruptions by
the mere force of authority."</p>

<p>This appeal to the pride of the young
nation is a curious instance of the growing
consciousness of Americanism which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
more rampant in Webster than in any of
his contemporaries. The passages which I
have been quoting intimate the deference
which Webster displayed toward the people.
He was one of the first to carry a
spirit of democracy into letters. Intense
Federalist as he was, his Federalism agreed
with a stout anti-aristocratic spirit; and
throughout his work one may detect a confidence
in the common sense of the people
which was as firm as Franklin's, and was
used, in his enthusiasm, to determine questions
in language and literature never before
brought to such a test. Unquestionably a
main source of Webster's strength and success
lay in this democratic instinct; it was
not patriotism alone, it was the spirit which
hailed the new democracy, and in its very
contempt of precedent and historic authority
disclosed its rude self-reliance.</p>

<p>This temper had a more favorable field
for its exhibition in the third part of "A
Grammatical Institute" which bore the sub-title:
"An American Selection of Lessons
in Reading and Speaking; calculated to
improve the Minds and refine the Taste of
Youth, and also to instruct them in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Geography, History, and Politics of the
United States. To which are prefixed
Rules in Elocution, and Directions for expressing
the Principal Passions of the
Mind." This laboriously emphatic title-page
bears the motto from Mirabeau: "Begin
with the infant in his cradle; let the
first word he lisps be Washington." In
strict accordance with this patriotic sentiment,
the compiler gives a series of lessons
which would not be inappropriate to any
girl or boy who in infancy had performed
the feat of lisping the easy-going name
which Mirabeau himself probably had some
difficulty in conquering. "In the choice of
pieces," says Webster in his preface, "I
have been attentive to the political interests
of America. I consider it as a capital
fault in all our schools that the books generally
used contain subjects wholly uninteresting
to our youth; while the writings
that marked the Revolution, which are perhaps
not inferior to the orations of Cicero
and Demosthenes, and which are calculated
to impress interesting truths upon young
minds, lie neglected and forgotten. Several
of those masterly addresses of Congress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
written at the commencement of the late
Revolution, contain such noble sentiments
of liberty and patriotism that I cannot help
wishing to transfuse them into the breasts
of the rising generation." Accordingly, he
makes abundant room in his book for orations
by Hancock, Warren, Livingston, and
Joel Barlow, and for poetry by Freneau,
Dwight, Barlow, and Livingston again, all
kept in countenance by Cicero, Publius
Scipio, Shakespeare, and Pope, while a
tribute is paid to "Mr. Andrus of Yale
College, since deceased," by the insertion
of "A Dialogue written in the year 1776."
To plump from Joel Barlow at the North
Church in Hartford, July 4, 1787, to a portion
of Cicero's oration against Verres, probably
produced no severe shock, since both
orations were intended as exercises in speaking,
and the former by its structure was removed
to about the same chronological distance
from the young speaker as the latter.
It would be a curious inquiry how far writers
of historical addresses in America have
from the beginning been affected by the
necessity which a regard for ancient models
laid upon them of fitting the facts of our Rev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>olutionary
War to oratorical periods, and
how far popular conceptions of the beginning
of our national life have been formed
by the "pieces" which young Americans
have been called upon to speak. The Roman
was the most distinguished predecessor
by name of this new republic, and enthusiastic
patriots went to it for literary furniture
as freely as their ancestors in New
England applied to the Jewish theocracy.
In the contemporary ephemeral literature
of the time there is a faint survival of the
older forms, but a more energetic reproduction
of Roman symbols, taken sometimes
directly from Latin literature and history,
sometimes indirectly from the chill Augustan
renaissance of the English eighteenth-century
literature. The interior manners
of the two periods are well contrasted in
two sets of letters, the earlier passing between
John and Margaret Winthrop, the
later between John and Abigail Adams.
The Scriptural allusions which crowd the
Winthrop letters have not wholly disappeared
in the Adams letters, but they are
more formally introduced as fragmentary
bits of wisdom, and appear side by side with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
quotations from Pliny and Rollin's "Ancient
History;" Mrs. Adams signs herself Portia;
the vessels which carry the letters are the
Apollo, the Juno, and the Minerva; and
classical allusions constitute a good share of
such playfulness as may be found.</p>

<p>The judgment with which Webster made
his reading selections largely from American
sources was not the result of a mere Anglo-phobia;
it was the product of an ardent,
hopeful patriotism trained within narrow
provincial bounds. Webster was not old
enough to have been much under the impression
of the English rule in America, and
his days had been spent in farming villages
where the traditions were little affected by
foreign life, or in a college which jumped
over intermediate centuries to find models
in Roman antiquity. His education, meaning
by that the cultivation of his powers
by what were literary or circumstantial influences,
had made him quite exclusively
an American and a republican; when he
began to give expression, therefore, to his
mind, he was unimpeded and unstimulated
by anything outside of the horizon of his
frugal life; he was not so much opposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to foreign culture as he was absolutely
ignorant of it; and in his career we are
called upon to observe the growth of a
mind as nearly native as was possible. If
I am not mistaken, that which was Webster's
weakness as an individual man was
his strength as the pioneer of education in
a new country.</p>

<h3>AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second and third parts of "A Grammatical
Institute" did not make Webster's
fame or fortune. The first part had in it
from the first the promise of success. It
may fairly be called the first book published
in the United States of America, and its
publication, under all the conditions of business
then, was a bold venture. Each State
was still a law to itself, and no general act
of Congress had yet been passed conferring
copyright. Webster's first business before
he had actually completed his spelling-book
was to secure copyright laws in the several
States, and he began a series of journeys to
Philadelphia and the state capitals for this
purpose. The history of his travels is the
history of the origin of copyright laws in
this country; and inasmuch as Webster has
himself related in detail the steps which he
took not only at this time, but later, I in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>troduce
here his statement, including in it a
correspondence with Daniel Webster which
has special interest at this time, when the
same considerations have been urged in the
renewed discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1782 I rode to Philadelphia
for the purpose of showing my
manuscripts to gentlemen of influence, and
obtaining a law for securing to authors the
copyright of their publications. As the legislatures
of New Jersey and Philadelphia
were not then in session, the latter object
could not then be accomplished. On my
way I called on Governor Livingston, then
in Trenton, and inquired whether it was
probable that a copyright law could be obtained
in New Jersey. The Governor replied
that if I would wait till noon he would
consult his council, then in session, and give
me an answer. At the time appointed I
called again, when the Governor told me the
council gave him very little encouragement.
In Princeton I waited on the Rev. Samuel
Stanhope Smith, then professor of theology
in Nassau Hall, and afterward president of
that institution, who examined my manuscripts,
recommended the works, and ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>pressed
his opinion in favor of copyright
laws....</p>

<p>"In October following I went to Hartford,
with a view to petition the Legislature
of Connecticut, then in session in that place,
for a law to secure to me the copyright of
my proposed book. The petition was presented,
but too late in the session to obtain
a hearing. I then returned to Goshen, and
devoted the winter to a revision of my manuscripts,
and the introduction of some improvements
which had been suggested by
gentlemen in Princeton and Philadelphia.
In January, 1783, I prepared another memorial
to be presented to the Legislature of
Connecticut, for the purpose of procuring
a copyright law, which memorial was committed
to the care of John Canfield, Esq.
But the necessity of it was superseded by
the enactment of a general law upon the
subject. This law was obtained by the petition
of several literary gentlemen in that
State.</p>

<p>"In the same winter I went to Kingston,
in Ulster County, New York, where the
legislature was in session, with a view to
present a petition for the like purpose. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
necessity of such petition was prevented by
the prompt attention of General Schuyler
to my request, through whose influence a
bill was introduced into the Senate, which
at the next session became a law. In the
same winter the Legislature of Massachusetts
enacted a copyright law, procured,
probably, by the agency of the Rev. Timothy
Dwight, then a member of the House
of Representatives.</p>

<p>"As Congress, under the Confederation,
had no power to protect literary property,
several gentlemen, among whom was Joel
Barlow, presented a memorial to that body,
petitioning them to recommend to the several
States the enactment of such a law.
In May, 1783, on the report of Mr. Williamson,
Mr. Izard, and Mr. Madison, Congress
passed a resolution, recommending to
the several States to secure to authors or
publishers of new books, not before printed,
the copyright of such books for a term not
less than fourteen years. In December,
1783, Governor Livingston informed me by
letter that the Legislature of New Jersey
had passed a law agreeable to the recommendation
of Congress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"In May, 1785, I undertook a journey
to the Middle and Southern States, one object
of which was to procure copyright laws
to be enacted. I proceeded to Charleston,
but the legislature not being in session, I
returned to Baltimore, where I spent the
summer. In November I visited General
Washington at his mansion; he gave me
letters to Governor Harrison in Richmond,
and to the speakers of both houses of the
legislature. The law desired was passed for
securing copyrights. In December I visited
Annapolis, where the legislature was in session;
and in February I visited Dover, in
Delaware, for the same purpose. On petition,
the Legislature of Delaware appointed
a committee to prepare a bill for a copyright
law, just at the close of the session,
but the enactment was deferred to the next
session. In the year 1790 Congress enacted
their first copyright law, which superseded
all the state laws on the subject.</p>

<p>"When I was in England in 1825 I
learned that the British Parliament had, a
few years before, enacted a new law on
copyrights, by which the rights of authors
were much extended. This led me to at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>tempt
to procure a new law in the United
States, giving a like extension to the rights
of authors. My first attempt appears in
the following letter [to the Hon. Daniel
Webster, dated September 30, 1826]:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Since the celebrated decision, respecting
copyright, by the highest British tribunal,
it seems to have been generally admitted
that an author has not a permanent
and exclusive right to the publication of his
original works at common law; and that
he must depend wholly on statutes for his
enjoyment of that right. As I firmly believe
this decision to be contrary to all our
best established principles of <i>right</i> and <i>property</i>,
and as I have reason to think such a
decision would not now be sanctioned by
the authorities of this country, I sincerely
desire that while you are a member of the
House of Representatives in Congress your
talents may be exerted in placing this species
of property on the same footing as all
property, as to exclusive right and permanence
of possession.</p>

<p>"'Among all modes of acquiring property,
or exclusive ownership, the act or operation
of <i>creating</i> or <i>making</i> seems to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the first claim. If anything can justly give
a man an exclusive right to the occupancy
and enjoyment of a thing it must be the
fact that he <i>made</i> it. The right of a farmer
and mechanic to the exclusive enjoyment
and right of disposal of what they <i>make</i> or
<i>produce</i> is never questioned. What, then,
can make a difference between the produce
of <i>muscular strength</i> and the produce of
the <i>intellect</i>? If it should be said that as
the purchaser of a bushel of wheat has obtained
not only the exclusive right to the
use of it for food, but the right to sow it
and increase and profit by it, let it be replied,
this is true; but if he sows the wheat
he must sow it on his own ground or soil.
The case is different with respect to the
copy of a book, which a purchaser has obtained,
for the copyright is the <i>author's soil</i>,
which the purchaser cannot legally occupy.</p>

<p>"'Upon what principles, let me ask, can
any fellow-citizens declare that the production
of the farmer and the artisan shall be
protected by common law, or the principles
of natural and social rights, without a special
statute, and without paying a premium
for the enjoyment of their property, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
they declare that I have only a temporary
right to the fruits of my labor, and even
this cannot be enjoyed without giving a premium?
Are such principles as these consistent
with the established doctrines of
property, and of moral right and wrong
among an enlightened people? Are such
principles consistent with the high and honorable
notions of justice and equal privileges
which our citizens claim to entertain and
to cherish, as characteristic of modern improvements
in civil society? How can the
<i>recent origin</i> of a particular species of property
vary the principles of ownership? I
say nothing of the inexpedience of such a
policy, as it regards the discouragement of
literary exertions. Indeed, I can probably
say nothing on this subject that you have
not said or thought; at least I presume you
have often contemplated this subject in all
its bearings.</p>

<p>"'The British Parliament, about ten or
twelve years ago, passed a new act on this
subject, giving to authors and proprietors of
new works an absolute right to the exclusive
use of the copyright for twenty-eight
years, with some other provisions which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
do not recollect; but the act makes or continues
the condition that the author or proprietor
shall deposit <i>eleven copies</i> of the
work in Stationers' Hall, for the benefit of
certain public libraries. This premium will
often amount to <i>fifty pounds sterling</i>, or
more. An effort was made by publishers
to obtain a repeal of this provision; but it
was opposed by the institutions which were
to receive the benefit, and the attempt
failed.</p>

<p>"'I have a great interest in this question,
and I think the interest of science and literature
in this question are by no means inconsiderable.
I sincerely wish our legislature
would come at once to the line of right
and justice on this subject, and pass a new
act, the preamble to which shall admit the
principle that an author has, by common
law, or natural justice, the sole and <i>permanent</i>
right to make profit by his own labor,
and that his heirs and assigns shall enjoy
the right unclogged with conditions. The
act thus admitting the right would prescribe
only the <i>mode</i> by which it shall be ascertained,
secured, and enjoyed, and violations
of the right punished; and perhaps make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
some provisions for the case of attempts to
elude the statute by slight alterations of
books by mutilations and transpositions.'</p>

<p>"To this letter Mr. Webster returned the
following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
"'<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>October 14, 1826</i>.
</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received yours of
the 30th of September, and shall, with your
permission, lay it before the committee of
the judiciary next session, as that committee
has in contemplation some important
changes in the law respecting copyright.
Your opinion, in the abstract, is certainly
right and uncontrovertible. Authorship is,
in its nature, ground of property. Most
people, I think, are as well satisfied (or better)
with the reasoning of Mr. Justice
Yates as with that of Lord Mansfield in
the great case of Miller and Taylor. But
after all, property, in the social state, must
be the creature of law; and it is a question
of expediency, high and general, not particular
expediency, how and how far the
rights of authorship should be protected.
I confess frankly that I see, or think I see,
objections to make it perpetual. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
same time I am willing to extend it further
than at present, and am fully persuaded
that it ought to be relieved from all charges,
such as depositing copies, etc.</p>

<p class="right">
"'Yours, <span class="smcap">D. Webster</span>.'<br /><br />
</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1827 I applied to the
Hon. Mr. Ingersoll, a representative from
Connecticut, stating to him the facts of an
extension of copyright in Great Britain, as
also in France, and requesting him to use
his influence to have a bill for a new law
brought forward in Congress. Mr. Ingersoll
very cheerfully complied. On the 17th
December, on the motion of Mr. Ingersoll,
the House of Representatives '<i>Resolved</i>,
that the committee on the judiciary inquire
into the expediency of extending the time
for which copyrights may be hereafter secured
to authors, beyond the period now allowed
by law; and also of affording further
protection to authors against the publication
of abridgments or summaries of works,
after the copyrights thereof have been secured.'
As the committee delayed several
weeks to make a report, Mr. Ingersoll conversed
fully on the subject with one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
members, and addressed a note to the committee,
in which he stated the provision of
the British Statute 34th Geo. III., enlarging
the rights of authors, and the liberal provisions
of the French laws on the subject.
He stated some of the defects of the old
law of the United States, and urged the expediency
and justice of a more liberal law.</p>

<p>"A petition signed by many respectable
literary men was, about this time, presented
to Congress, praying for the same object.
Some members of the committee were opposed
to the measure; but at length, on
the first of February, 1828, the committee
reported a bill consisting of three sections
only, extending the term of copyrights from
fourteen to twenty-eight years, and securing
the benefit of the act to authors who
had previously obtained a copyright under
the old law. On the 21st of February,
Mr. Verplanck submitted to the House of
Representatives an amendment to the bill
reported by the committee, entitled an
'Amendment to a Bill to amend and consolidate
the Acts respecting Copyrights.'
This amendment was printed by order of
the House. It was intended to embrace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
all the material provisions of the two former
laws, and those of the bill reported by the
judiciary committee; it contained also some
additional improvements. Nothing further
was done, and the bill and amendment died
at the close of the session.</p>

<p>"At the next session (1829-1830) the
Hon. Mr. Ellsworth, a member from Connecticut,
was appointed one of the judiciary
committee, of which the Hon. Mr. Buchanan
was chairman. Before Mr. Ellsworth left
home, I applied to him to make efforts to
procure the enactment of a new copyright
law, and sent a petition to Congress, praying
for the renewal of the copyright of one
of my books. This petition, being referred
to the judiciary committee, brought the subject
distinctly into consideration. After
consultation, the committee authorized Mr.
Ellsworth to prepare a bill for a general
law on the subject. In order to present
the subject in its true light to the committee
and to Congress, Mr. Ellsworth wrote notes
to the ministers of the principal European
nations, requesting information from each
of them respecting the state of copyrights
in the nations they represented. From their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
answers, and an inspection of the laws of
some of the governments, Mr. Ellsworth
framed a report, stating the terms of time
for which copyrights are secured to authors
in Great Britain, France, Russia, Sweden,
Denmark, and certain states in Germany.
He also framed a bill for a law intended to
embrace all the material provisions of the
old laws with those of the bill reported by
the former judiciary committee.</p>

<p>"In this bill Mr. Ellsworth introduced
some valuable provisions which had been
omitted in the old laws, and in the bill and
amendment offered at the former session.
He also obtained from his friends some suggestions
which enabled him to correct some
errors and supply defects. This bill was
approved by the judiciary committee, reported
by Mr. Ellsworth, and printed by
order of the House. But such was the
pressure of business, and so little interest
was felt in the bill, that no efforts of Mr.
Ellsworth could bring it before the House
at that session.</p>

<p>"Finding the efforts of the friends of the
bill in Congress to be unavailing to obtain
a hearing, I determined in the winter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
1830-1831 to visit Washington myself, and
endeavor to accomplish the object. Accordingly
I took lodgings at the seat of government,
where I passed nine or ten weeks;
and during this time read a lecture in the
Hall of the Representatives, which was well
attended, and, as my friends informed me,
had no little effect in promoting the object
of obtaining a law for securing copyrights.</p>

<p>"The difficulties which had prevented
the bill from being brought forward now
disappeared. The bill, at the second reading
in the House of Representatives, met
with some opposition; but it was ably supported
by Mr. Ellsworth, Mr. Verplanck,
and Mr. Huntington. It passed to a third
reading by a large majority, and was ordered
to be engrossed without opposition.
When the bill came before the Senate, it
was referred to the judiciary committee.
Mr. Rowan, the chairman, being absent, the
committee requested the Hon. Daniel Webster
to take the bill, examine it, and report
it if he thought proper; he did so, and under
all circumstances deemed it expedient to report
it without amendment. On the second
reading Mr. Webster made a few ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>planatory
remarks: no other person uttered
a word on the subject; and it passed to a
third reading by a unanimous vote. On the
third reading, the Senate, on motion, dispensed
with the reading, and it passed to
be engrossed, without debate.</p>

<p>"In my journeys to effect this object,
and in my long attendance in Washington,
I expended nearly a year of time. Of my
expenses in money I have no account, but
it is a satisfaction to me that a liberal statute
for securing to authors the fruit of their
labor has been obtained."<br /><br /></p>



<p>In this summary the whole history of the
copyright statutes appears, and it is interesting
to note that the earliest action by
the States and Congress received its impulse
from Webster's spelling-book; the later and
final form of the law was adopted in connection
with Mr. Webster's indefatigable
efforts, and the first book to take advantage
of it was his "American Dictionary." His
keen sense of the business relations of his
literary work is seen in this early and late
energy in securing satisfactory copyright
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>laws. It is noticeable, too, that in his correspondence
with Daniel Webster he took
the position which has of late been held as
the only solution of all copyright questions.
Noah Webster may not have been a great
man in his generation, but he had a singular
faculty of being the first in time in many
departments of literary industry, and constantly
to have anticipated other people.</p>

<p>Wherever he went he showed the rough
draft of his book; he assailed members of
Congress and men of eminence generally.
He had faith in it, and he lived at a time
when the individual testimony of men was
of greater weight than now. There were
no organs of literary or educational opinion,
no academies or bodies of men especially
esteemed as juries in the case of any
book on trial, and indorsements were looked
for as essential to the success of any new
venture. There was no great public to
show its interest by buying, and there were
no publishers of capital and organization
to relieve the author of publishing labor.
In the recently published correspondence
of Jeremy Belknap and Ebenezer Hazard,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
one may read the difficulties encountered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
by a scholarly man in getting his historical
work published. The correspondence for
two years between these gentlemen, with
reference to the publication of Belknap's
"History of New Hampshire," a volume of
five hundred pages, shows that every detail
of paper, print, and binding, and almost all
arrangements for securing subscriptions, fell
upon the author and his friend, acting for
and with him. Subscribers were sought
with painful endeavor, one at a time, and
all the points at issue were discussed in letters
which seemed sometimes to travel by
chance.</p>

<p>Webster, without money, and almost without
friends, but with the kind of faith which
works miracles with other people's faith,
succeeded at length in persuading Hudson
&amp; Goodwin, printers in Hartford, to issue
an edition of five thousand copies of the
spelling-book. John Trumbull and Joel
Barlow were his chief supporters, the latter
backing him with a little money. The
printer was the publisher then; and an
author, in making his arrangements, was accustomed
to sell the right to print and publish
to various printers in various parts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the country,&mdash;a custom which continued
through the first quarter of the century.
The isolation of the several settled communities
rendered collision between the
several dealers unlikely; and, in the absence
of quick communication, no place had any
advantage except as a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for the neighboring
district. Rights to print were granted
for fourteen years. Such a contract was
made in 1818 by Webster with Mr. Hudson,
who was to pay $3,000 a year during
the term. The reader will recall similar
arrangements in Irving's ventures. The
popularity of the speller rendered it liable
to piracy, especially in the ruder parts of
the country, and as late as 1835 Mr. Webster
writes to his son, established as a
bookseller in Louisville: "I would suggest
whether it would not be advisable to publish
in Kentucky, or at least in Tennessee,
a short note like this: 'The Public are cautioned
against buying "Webster's American
Spelling-Book;" the editions now in
the market are pirated, badly printed, and
incorrect. The author expressly disclaims
them.'"</p>

<p>The final success of the little book has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
been quite beyond definite computation, but
a few figures will show something of the
course it has run. In 1814, 1815, the sales
averaged 286,000 copies a year; in 1828 the
sales were estimated to be 350,000 copies.
In 1847 the statement was made that about
twenty-four million copies of the book had
been published up to that time, and that
the sale was then averaging a million of
copies a year. It was also then said, that
during the twenty years in which he was
employed in compiling his "American Dictionary,"
the entire support of his family
was derived from the profits of this work,
at a premium for copyright of five mills a
copy. The sales for eight years following
the Civil War, namely, 1866-1873, aggregated
8,196,028; and the fact that the average
yearly sale was scarcely greater than in
1847 may be referred in part to the great
enterprise in the publication of school-books,
which has marked the last twenty years, by
which his speller has been one only of a
great many, in part, also, to the impoverishment
of the South where Webster's book
had been more generally accepted than at
the North.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>The great demand that there was for
elementary school-books, the real advance
of Webster's over any then existing, the
promptness with which he met the first
call, all these causes combined to give a
great impetus to the little book. At first
sight there seems something amusing in the
importance which not only Webster but
other men of the time attached to the spelling-book.
Timothy Pickering, in camp at
Newburgh, waiting for the final word of
disbanding, sat up into the night to read
it! "By the eastern post yesterday," he
writes to his wife, "I was lucky enough to
receive the new spelling-book [Webster's]
I mentioned in my last, and instead of
sleeping (for I had a waking fit which prevented
me), I read it through last night,
except that I only examined a part of the
different tables. I am much pleased with
it. The author is ingenious, and writes
from his own experience as a school-master,
as well as the best authorities; and the time
will come when no authority, as an English
grammarian, will be superior to his
own. It is the very thing I have so long
wished for, being much dissatisfied with any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
spelling-book I had seen before. I now
send you the book, and request you to let
John take it to his master, with the enclosed
letter; for I am determined to have
him instructed upon this new, ingenious,
and, at the same time, easy plan. There
are, you will see by the Introduction, two
more parts to come to complete the plan.
I am a stranger to Mr. Webster, but I intend,
when I can find leisure, to write him
on the subject, using the liberty (which he
requests) to suggest some little matters
which may be altered and improved in his
next edition, for I think the work will do
honor to his country, and I wish it may be
perfect. Many men of literature might
think it too trifling a subject; but I am of
a different opinion, and am happy that a
gentleman of Mr. Webster's genius and
learning has taken it up. All men are
pleased with an elegant pronunciation, and
this new Spelling-Book shows children how
to acquire it with ease and certainty."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Pickering's letter helps us to get behind
"Webster's Spelling-Book" in 1783, instead
of looking at it from this later vantage-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>ground
of an accumulated American literature.
There runs through the correspondence
of that day a tone which we easily call
provincial, but is nevertheless a distinct expression
of the consciousness of the young
nation. The instinct of literature is toward
self-centring, and the sense of national being
was very strong in men who had been giving
their days and nights to the birth of a
new nation. To understand the state of
things in 1783 we should look at the
literary ventures, inclusive of educational,
within the boundaries of the Southern
States during the War of 1861-1865. There
the interruption of commerce with the North
compelled a resort to home production in
school-book literature, and intensity of feeling
upon sectional questions found frequent
expression in spelling-books and arithmetics.
"Webster's Elementary" was reprinted
at Macon, without illustrations and
some of the diacritical marks, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.
The reader finds the morals of the
book and the earlier patriotism unchanged,
but remembers its latitude when he reads:
"The Senate of the Confederate States is
sailed the Upper House of Congress: The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
President of the Confederate States is elective
once every six years: The Confederate
States have a large extent of sea-coast, and
many parts of the Confederate States are
noted for the fertility of the soil." But
these are innocent adaptations; one must
look to the arithmetics for sectional feeling.</p>

<p>In Webster's time, men whose lives had
been spent in the struggle for independence
and autonomy looked upon everything relating
to their country with a concentration
of interest which not only attested the sincerity
of their convictions, but made them
indifferent to the larger, more universal
standards. They were seeing things with
American, not European eyes. When Dr.
Belknap and his friend Mr. Hazard were
carefully arranging for the publication of
the "History of New Hampshire," they
made proposals to the Longmans, in London,
to take an edition, without any apparent
suspicion that such a book might lack
readers in England. The publishers' polite
reply intimates the "apprehension that the
history of one particular province of New
England would not be of sufficient importance
to engage the attention of this coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>try,
and particularly as it is at present
brought down no lower than the year 1714."
Belknap's History is an admirable piece of
work, the first scholarly work of its kind
on this side of the water, and Dr. Belknap
respected his book. To him, as to many of
that generation, a book was a serious undertaking,
and each new one that came was
carefully weighed and its character measured;
a history of New Hampshire was not
a mere piece of local self-complacency, but a
dignified adventure into a portion of American
history hitherto unexplored. The work
expended upon it was as careful and grave
as if the subject had been the Peloponnesian
War. Indeed, one of the substantial
evidences of the historic justification of the
war for independence is to be found in the
alacrity with which the scholarly element
in the country busied itself about themes
which were close at hand and connected
with the land of their life.</p>

<p>Literature in its finer forms had but slender
encouragement. The absence of easy
communication, the poverty of the people,
the dispersion of the population, gave little
chance for bookstores and circulating libra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>ries
and private accumulation. It must not
be forgotten, either, that the era of cheap
books had not yet come in England, and
that the periodical form was still in embryo.
To look back on one of the rather juiceless
periodicals which sprang up so frequently
at the beginning of our literature because
they had no depth of earth, and withered
away rootless and sunstruck, is to be over-taken
half with scorn for their pretense,
and half with pity for conductors and readers,
who had to make believe very hard to
find them quite nice. "They would bear a
little more seasoning certainly," like the
marchioness's orange-peel and water; yet
how strong must have been the passion for
literature when money was expended and
pains taken with these hopeless ventures.
The change in popular taste, moreover, must
not mislead us into supposing that writings
which are arid to us now were necessarily
devoid of interest to contemporary readers.
We take down from the shelf the solitary
volume which contains the "American Magazine,"
and its reading-matter looks as faded
to our eyes as the leather upon the covers,
but it was once the latest publication of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
day. We can with little difficulty imagine
that the monthly report of Warren Hastings'
trial, with its plan of the High Court
at Westminster, would have an interest at
the time quite as reasonable in its way as
that which held readers of journals, not so
long extinct, over the details of the Tichborne
case. It is in the field of polite literature
that our later taste refuses to discover
anything in common with the readers of the
"American Magazine." What impresses
one most in such a periodical is the value
which the conductors set upon American
historical material. This was offered to the
public with all the assurance which now attends
the promise of a great serial story.
The explanation may most reasonably be
found in the fact, that the subscribers to
any such magazine at the time must have
been sought among the well educated, and
this class had been used chiefly to a serious
view of literature.</p>

<p>The "American Magazine" was Webster's
venture, and in the Belknap and Hazard
correspondence one may find some curious
incidents in the struggle for existence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>which the magazine had. It should be premised
that neither of these gentlemen&mdash;and
they represented the most cultivated
class of the day&mdash;had much confidence in
Webster. They nicknamed him the "Monarch,"
possibly from some assumption and
arrogance in his tone, and he is rarely mentioned
by them except in a slighting manner.
"<i>I</i> think the <i>Monarch</i> a literary
puppy, from what little I have seen of him,"
writes Hazard to Belknap. "He certainly
does not want understanding, and yet there
is a mixture of self-sufficiency, all-sufficiency,
and at the same time a degree of insufficiency
about him, which is (to me) intolerable.
I do <i>not</i> believe that <i>he</i> is fit for a
superintendent; that the persons mentioned
will be his coadjutors, or that either the <i>demand</i>
or the <i>profits</i> will be any way near
equal to his expectations. His specimens
already published [three numbers of the
'American Magazine'] are below mediocrity,
and even in them <i>he</i> is too much the
hero of the tale. His plan of a <i>Federal</i>
publication, if sensible, judicious men could
be engaged to execute it, and an editor of
the same stamp could be procured, I think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>would do well. <i>Considering circumstances</i>,
I would not advise you to engage with, him,
but I think you may avail yourself of his
application with the Columbians; only take
care to do it in such a way that you may
not, between two stools, fall to the ground."</p>

<p>The "Columbian" was a magazine of a
little older standing to which Dr. Belknap
had been contributing (his "Foresters"
appeared there), and the incident of the
worldly-wise Hazard, gently encouraging the
clergyman to play the rivals against each
other, has at least an approach to modern
literary history. Webster, with his restlessness,
had no sooner launched the "American
Magazine" than he began to form other
projects, as intimated in Hazard's letter,
and wished to secure not only Belknap's
pen, but his more active partnership. Hazard
writes again to his friend, after being
asked for further advice: "I am really at
a loss how to advise you, but think, upon
the whole, I would let the Columbians know
that 'my necessities also compelled the making
a close bargain;' that I had been applied
to in behalf of the New York magazine,
but felt myself so much interested in
their success (having been so long connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with them) that I did not like to leave
them, provided they would stipulate to allow
me, <i>certainly</i>, what I deemed a reasonable
compensation for my assistance, which
they acknowledge they do not now allow;
and that, upon their doing this, I would continue
to aid them. If you can contribute
the stipulated assistance to them in case you
accept N. W.'s proposal, I see no reason
why you should not do the latter too; for,
if you fulfill your engagements, you do them
no injustice. You may, in this case, as well
have two strings to your bow as not, and I
think I would advise to it, especially as the
'Columbian's' continuance is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I
would inform N. W. that some consideration
was necessary respecting his plan; but
that I was, upon the whole, inclined to think
I would join him, if he could get the other
gentlemen he mentioned to me to be concerned.
I think no <i>cash</i> is to be advanced
by you, upon his plan. It will be some
months before he can begin, and I would
not exclude myself from a chance."</p>

<p>Dr. Belknap's letters to Webster unfortu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>nately do not appear, but his friend, through
whom he wrote, commends him for his prudence.
"I find," he writes, "you have not
a more exalted idea of the Monarch than I
have. I should not be fond of a connection
with him, unless I saw it clearly to my interest."
He praises him also for his exertions
in behalf of the feeble "Columbian,"
which owed its life to him, in his opinion.
Oddly enough, after all of Hazard's cautions
and advice to Belknap, he seems himself to
have been involved in negotiations with
Webster, and from this point the correspondence
has more interest as throwing
light upon the estimation in which literary
material was held at the time. Mr. Hazard
had for a long time been making a collection
of papers bearing upon American colonial
history, and had not seen his way clear to a
profitable publication of them. Noah Webster
suddenly appears as the agent for a
new magazine in which he has a slight interest,
and makes proposals to Mr. Hazard.
It is amusing to see how shy Hazard is of
any close connection with Webster, and yet
how continually Webster appears in the
foreground in the affair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you think," writes Hazard
to Belknap, "of my collection of papers
coming to light after lying in obscurity so
long? It is likely to be the case. The
'American Magazine' is to appear in a new
form,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and on an extensive plan, and to be
the property of <i>a society</i> of gentlemen,
among whom N. W. holds but one share;
and I am told he is going to remove from
hence [New York] to Connecticut, so that
he will not be the editor. Their plan is to
publish one hundred and four pages monthly,
fifty-six of them are to be in the usual
magazine style, twenty-four are to contain
State Papers, and twenty-four either historical
<i>MSS.</i>, such as 'Winthrop's Journal,'
or a republication of ancient, valuable, and
scarce American histories, such as Smith's
of Virginia, etc., etc. N. W. called, to know
if I would dispose of my collection for this
purpose, informing me that they intended
to print in such a way that the State Papers
and histories might be detached from the
magazine and bound by themselves. After
considering of the matter, I concluded to let
them have the collection for &pound;500, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
they agreed to give. I don't altogether like
this way of publishing the papers; but when
I reflected on the great uncertainty of my
being able to publish them at all, the risque
I run by their remaining <i>in statu quo</i>, and
the little probability that I should clear
&pound;500 by them if I should publish, I thought
it best to say yes. The money is to be paid
by installments. All this is <i>inter nos</i>."</p>

<p>Dr. Belknap now had an opportunity to
repay his friend's favors in kind, and in
acknowledging the letter just quoted he
writes: "I could wish that you would take
off the restriction of secrecy, so far as it
relates to the intended publication of the
magazine and its appendage, because I apprehend
it may be in my power to set on
foot a similar publication here; and the
knowledge that such a design is on foot
elsewhere may prove a stimulus to the undertaking."
He prudently remarks that
the sale made by his friend is good, "provided
the purchasers do not fail in the payment."
Hazard returns to the matter in
his next letter: "With respect to the <i>MSS.</i>
I made a pretty <i>safe</i> bargain, and yet much
will depend on the success of the publica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tion
as to the <i>quickness</i> of the pay.... By
agreement I am to hand my papers out
in monthly portions, and in chronological
order. The January magazine, or rather
<i>Register</i>, is to contain twenty-four pages of
them, and as many of 'Winthrop's Journal.'
The design of the intended publication is no
secret now, having been advertised in the
newspapers; but I write you not to say anything
about what I am to have for my
papers.... N. W. had printed six sheets
of Winthrop, but, upon the new plan's striking
him, he thought it best to publish in
the new mode; and I am told he will lose
his expense so far, for his paper is not so
fine as the new work is to be done upon,
<i>inter nos</i>."</p>

<p>Suddenly Hazard writes to Belknap that
Webster is likely to call upon him, and that
if he offers him a partnership in the new
magazine, he is not at once to decline. It
is not worth while to follow the ins and
outs of the correspondence upon a scheme
which finally fell through, but a full letter
from Hazard to Belknap may fairly be
drawn from, since it puts one into tolerably
complete possession of the whole story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must know that N. W. has been
for some time trying to get my State Papers
published, and he has generally proposed
it in such a way as to have a share
in them himself. Several plans were proposed,
and at last the idea of the Register
was started. He called on me and told me
that he had been speaking with some other
gentlemen about being concerned in the
'American Magazine,' and that they were
to be concerned with him. He informed me
of their plan, and wished me to join them,
and that my papers might be published in
the Register. He intimated that he had
five hundred subscribers [to the 'American
Magazine'] who would continue to take the
new work, and that the improvement proposed
would greatly increase the number
of subscribers. I objected against being a
partner, but had no objection against letting
them have my papers for &pound;500. After
a variety of negotiations, I consented to become
a partner,&mdash;and they agreed to allow
me &pound;500 for my papers, to be paid out of
the profits of the publication,&mdash;if they
would yield me &pound;50 per annum, at least,
clear of my share of all expenses; if not, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
other proprietors were to make up that sum
to me annually; and, should the work be
discontinued before I was paid, they were
then to pay me as much as with my profits
(all expenses first deducted) would make
&pound;500. Regular written articles were drawn,
and executed by all but one partner, who
has not yet signed them, nor will, 'til he
sees such a number of subscribers in this
city [New York] and its vicinity as will defray
the actual expense of the work. The
<i>profits</i> he is willing to risque. He is a discreet,
sensible man, and will be what the
sailors call our <i>main stay</i>. After the articles
were executed, some of the proprietors observed
that they had given their bond to
me for &pound;500, which must be paid at all
events, and that I was to run no risque,
and, in fact, to pay no expense,&mdash;which
was not putting matters on a fair footing
with respect to them (before the time the
proposals were published). They came
and stated the case to me. I immediately
saw the propriety of their remarks, and
without hesitation agreed to a new article,
that their bond for the price of my papers
should not be in force immediately <i>upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
their publishing</i> (which was the case before),
but that they might publish for three
months; if they then discontinued the publication,
the bond was to be of no effect;
if they continued it after that period, it was
to be in full force; and I agreed to furnish
my proportion of the State Papers, <i>i. e.</i>,
that, as there were four proprietors, the
others should pay me but &pound;375,&mdash;the remaining
&pound;125 being my proportion of the
cost of the papers. Thus relief was given
on equitable principles.</p>

<p>"In the course of our conversations, at
different times, <i>writers</i> were talked of; N.
W. mentioned you. I agreed that you
would be a very suitable person, if you
could be got to engage in it, but was apprehensive
your situation would not admit
of it. N. W. had no doubt you could be
engaged, for he was very confident (or well
persuaded, or something of that kind) that
you wrote for the 'Columbian,' and were
paid for it; and he ascribed the biographical
pieces, in particular, to you. Upon my
asking the reasons of his opinion, he replied
that he did not know (or believe) that anybody
else possessed suitable materials; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
I suspect he has had more particular information
in Philadelphia. It was suggested
among the proprietors that Thomas's magazine<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
would interfere with us in Massachusetts,
where we hope for a number of
subscribers; and N. W. afterwards hinted
to me the idea of a coalition, which I was
pleased with. He told me he was going to
the eastward, and would talk with Thomas
about it. I <i>supposed</i> that he would talk
with <i>you</i> too, and gave you the hint that
you might be prepared. It seems he has
done so; and by last post I received proposals
for an union, which I have laid before
the proprietors here, and they are disapproved
of. Upon this plan, the <i>Register</i>
was to be printed here, and the <i>Magazine</i>
in Boston. One of the proprietors here
was to furnish half the matter for the magazine
monthly, and forward it to Boston,
where N. W. was to act as editor, or engage
Mr. Belknap, or some person of equal ability,
to act for him; and this editor was to
furnish the other half of the matter. As
a compensation for my papers, I was to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a proprietor of a seventh of both publications,
for they were to be separate. All
expenses, bad debts, and other losses were
to be divided equally among the partners.
These proposals were signed by Noah Webster
and Isaiah Thomas &amp; Co. In a letter
to me, N. W. sent a calculation, by which he
attempted to prove that the value of a share
would be near &pound;200 per annum. Such an
hint might have done for a person unacquainted
with the nature of the business,
but old birds want a more substantial temptation
than chaff. A principal objection
against the plan of union was the risque
and expense of sending materials and publications
backwards and forwards through
so great a distance: one failure would be
fatal to one month's magazine, and a repetition
of such a disaster would discourage
subscribers. The subscribers here would
probably not be satisfied with a magazine
printed elsewhere, and could not be furnished
with one so early in the month;
and, for my part, I am not willing to give
up my papers on so precarious a chance of
a recompense.</p>

<p>"N. W. (notwithstanding his obligation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
under hand and seal) confesses himself unwilling
to continue the Magazine and Register
on our first plan; and I am much mistaken
if the other proprietors do not disappoint
him by taking him at his word and
releasing him from his obligations; for his
being known to be concerned makes the
subscription go on heavily (this <i>inter nos</i>).
<i>His</i> magazine was a paltry performance,
and people fear a continuation of it. We
cannot find his five hundred subscribers yet.
We have but about two hundred in this
city, most of whom have been tempted by
my papers, as is said. We agreed among
ourselves not to let the proprietors be
known, but N. W. has let the cat quite out
of the bag. I am clear for going on without
him, which I think may be done better
than with him; and my plan would be that
a sufficient number of literary characters
should be united to make the most, if not
the whole, of the magazine <i>original</i>. The
profits upon each share (especially at first)
would be but small; but so, on the other
hand, would be the risque. Suppose there
should be <i>no</i> profit for a year or two, and
that the work should but barely defray the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
expense for that time, yet it may be presumed
that, if it was conducted with spirit,
the public would patronize it, being sure of
original entertainment, and that at length
the property would become very valuable.
What do you think of this idea?"</p>

<p>Dr. Belknap's reply to this letter is the
last reference to the project which has any
interest: "The Monarch called upon me
last Monday evening, when I was abroad,
and left word that he should come again
next day at noon, <i>upon business</i>. The <i>real</i>
business was to fish out what I had heard
from you. I had then received only your
short letter, and told him that I had heard
nothing. He talked about the magazine,
and about my being a partner, and about
the business of an editor, and about his being
a lawyer (which, by the way, was new
to me), and about the value of a share,
which, as he then estimated it, would be
from &pound;50 to &pound;100 per annum, etc., etc., but
expected to hear from you and the proprietors
more particularly by the next post,
and then we were to have a farther conference.
The next post brought me your
long letter, and he has not made his appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ance
since. I suppose, by what you say in
<i>confidence</i> to me, that he finds he cannot be
director general, and possibly suspects that
he may have very little to do. I find myself
under some embarrassment with regard
to this <i>personage</i>. However, as he is going
to marry into a family with some branches
of which I have long had a very agreeable
connection, I must suffer myself to be in a
degree of acquaintance with him, especially
if (as he <i>threatens</i>) he should make this
place [Boston] his future residence. If I
cannot esteem him as a friend, I do not
wish to make him an enemy, and I am very
awkward in the art of Chesterfield. Hence
arises my embarrassment. What he has told
Thomas I know not, but I must do him
the justice to say that he did not tell me
the names of any of the proprietors, excepting
yourself and himself; nor do I know
who the others are."</p>

<p>Hazard's papers were finally published
by themselves, and the Magazine and Register
never got beyond the proposals point.
Before the collection was published, however,
another magazine loomed up, for the
regular failure of each venture never seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
to dampen the ardor of magazine projectors.
The story of the enterprise sketched in
these letters may be taken as the story of
all,&mdash;sanguine literary men and inert subscribers;
a class of material is reckoned
upon which always seems abundant, vastly
interesting to the persons who hold it, but
insufficient to beguile subscribers. Mr.
Hazard, with his collection of papers, expects
five hundred pounds, and his associates
think him not unreasonable, especially
after he agrees to pay one fourth himself;
and with all his prudence and shrewdness he
begins to count on the profits of the magazine
with something of Webster's facile hope.</p>

<p>Webster himself, in spite of the dislike
with which Hazard and Belknap agreed to
regard him, appears in an honorable light.
No doubt he was consequential and eager
to have a hand in what was going on, but
he had the confidence and courage which
seem to have been lacking in his associates.
His impulsive dashes at literature and capricious
excursions into the realms of language
were offensive to highly conservative
and orderly scholars like these correspondents,
and they sniffed at him rather con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>temptuously;
but Webster could disregard
the criticism of others when he had such
unbounded self-reliance and zeal. He did
not count the cost carefully of what he undertook,
but allowed himself the luxury of
seizing at once upon what engaged his interest.
The publication of "Winthrop's
Journal," referred to in the correspondence,
was an undertaking which a more scholarly
man might have set about with greater care
and deliberation. Webster never read the
original. He saw a copy from it in the
possession of Governor Trumbull, and, perceiving
the value of the material, made
haste to get it published. He employed a
secretary of the governor, who made a copy
of the copy, comparing it with the original,
which Webster had never seen. Mr. Savage,
the learned editor of the Journal in its
complete form, sarcastically says: "The
celebrated philologist, <i>who in his English
Dictionary triumphed over the difficulties</i> of
derivation in our etymology from Danish,
Russian, Irish, Welsh, German, high or low,
Sanscrit, Persian, or Chaldee fountains,
might, after exhausting his patience, have
reputably shrunk from encounter with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
manuscript of Winthrop." But it was
something for Webster to have succeeded
in securing a publication of the book in
1790, and the credit due him is not lessened
by the fact that he risked his whole property
in the enterprise, and lost money.</p>

<p>He was at this time far from being settled
in life. For half a dozen years he had been
scrambling along as well as he could, teaching,
lecturing, practicing a little law, working
his books, writing for the newspapers,
securing the passage of copyright laws, trying
this city and that with new ventures,
none of which gave him a subsistence.
Meanwhile, he had met in Philadelphia a
Boston lady, whom his diary shows him to
have followed with the zeal of his ardent
nature; and it is not to be wondered at that
he carried his point here, as so often elsewhere,
and settled, as he thought at the
time, in Hartford, in 1789, with his wife,
Rebecca, daughter of Mr. William Greenleaf,
of Boston. His brief account of himself
at this date was in the summary: "I
had an enterprising turn of mind, was bold,
vain, and inexperienced." John Trumbull,
writing to Oliver Wolcott, announces that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"Webster has returned, and brought with
him a pretty wife. I wish him success, but
I doubt, in the present decay of business in
our profession [the law], whether his profits
will enable him to keep up the style he sets
out with. I fear he will breakfast upon Institutes,
dine upon Dissertations, and go to
bed supperless." The breakfast was indeed
likely to prove the only substantial meal;
how substantial it proved we have already
noticed. No doubt Webster appeared to his
friends, as half to himself, a restless, uneasy
man, incapable of steady application to law,
and making hazardous ventures in literature
in that combined character of author
and publisher which the circumstances of
the time rendered almost necessary to any
one who undertook to make a profession of
letters.</p>

<p>It is a little significant of Webster's relation
to literature that he moved outside
of the knot of men known in our literary
history as the Hartford wits. So many recent
claimants for the position of democratic
jester have engaged the public attention
that the Hartford wits who amused
our grandfathers rest their fame now rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
upon tradition than upon any perennial liveliness.
By their solitude in the pages of
American literature their very title has acquired
a certain gravity, and we are apt
to regard them with respect rather than
to read them for amusement. Fossil wits
seem properly to be classed with the formation
from which they are dug, and not
with living types of the same order. Yet
no picture of the times in which Webster
lived would be complete without a slight
reminiscence of this coterie, and the fact
that Webster was the neighbor of these
men and himself living by letters suggests
a fresh illustration of the truth that kinship
in literature is something finer and closer
than mere circumstantial neighborliness.
Trumbull, Hopkins, Alsop, Dwight, and the
minor stars in this twinkling galaxy, were
staunch Federalists, and the occasion of their
joint efforts was chiefly political, but Webster's
Federalism did not give him a place
in the set.</p>

<p>The "Echo" was the title which the wits
gave to a series of satires that mocked the
prose of the day. If an editor published a
piece of bloated writing, the bubble was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
pricked by the poetical version; if a politician
disclosed his weakness, his words were
caught up and made to turn him into ridicule.
The wits were on the lookout for
humbug in any quarter, but they had their
pet aversions, Sam Adams and the Jacobins
being oftenest pilloried. A bombastic
account of a thunder-storm in Boston appears
to have given occasion for the first
skit, and it was scarcely necessary to do
more than parody the grandiloquent newspaper
language. "The clouds soon dissipated,
and the appearance of the azure
vault left trivial hopes of further needful
supplies from the uncorked bottles of
heaven. In a few moments the horizon
was again overshadowed, and an almost impenetrable
gloom mantled the face of the
skies.... The majestic roar of disploded
thunders, now bursting with a sudden crash,
and now wasting the rumbling <span class="smcap">ECHO</span> of their
sounds in other lands, added indescribable
grandeur to the sublime scene." The suggestion
of the "Echo" came from this
phrase, and the success of the first venture
easily directed the writers into the use of
their instrument for lashing political ene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>mies.
Two numbers were given to matters
of trivial or temporary interest, and then
there was a shot at a piece of fustian in
the "Boston Argus" on Liberty, followed
shortly after by a gibe at some correspondent
of the "Argus," who frantically exclaimed,
on the occasion of a town meeting
refusing to hear Sam Adams: "Shall Europe
hear, shall our Southern brethren be
told, that Samuel Adams rose to speak in
the midst of his fellow-citizens, and was silenced!"
A few lines from this satire will
best illustrate the vigorous treatment which
the wits employed, and the gusto with
which they jostled the great Democrat:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>The most of the succeeding numbers had
reference to politics, but room was found for
excursions in other fields: "Monier's Advertisement
for a School," and "Newtonian
Philosophy," served as pegs from which to
hang rhymed jests, and the writers would
very likely have taken a wider range if there
had been a wider range in public interests.
But politics dominated thought, and the
wits were as bitter partisans as they were
clever rhymesters. The poetry of the anti-Jacobin
supplied them with the suggestion
of form; but there was not the lightness of
touch or deft mimicry which characterized
those remarkable political skits. As one
reads the "Echo," and the "Green-house,"
and Trumbull's "McFingal," he is constantly
reminded of the heaviness of the education
which formed the substance of the
writers' preparation for their task. The
rudeness of the satire is the rudeness of a
homespun society.</p>

<p>The authors of the "Echo," when the
series came to be reissued in a volume, provided
a somewhat solemn preface, in which
they say: "The principal poems in this
volume, under the title of the 'Echo,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
owed their origin to the accidental suggestion
of a moment of literary sportiveness,
at a time when pedantry, affectation, and
bombast pervaded most of the pieces published
in the gazettes, which were then the
principal vehicles of literary information.
Willing to lend their aid to check the progress
of false taste in American literature,
the authors conceived that ridicule would
prove a powerful corrective, and that the
mode employed in the 'Echo' was the
best suited to this purpose.... But the
ridicule of a vitiated mode of writing was
not long the sole object of the 'Echo.'
The important political changes which soon
after occurred, not only in Europe, but in
America, produced a corresponding change
in the republic of letters; and some of the
principal gazettes of this country exhibited
a disgusting display, not only of a perversion
of taste in composition, but a still
greater perversion of principle, in that hideous
morality of revolutionary madness,
which, priding itself in an emancipation
from moral obligation, leveled the boundaries
of virtue and vice, while it contemptuously
derided the most amiable and sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
feelings of our nature. Disgusted with the
cruelties exhibited by the French Revolution
at a very early stage of its progress,
and viewing it as a consuming fire, which,
in the course of its conflagration, threatened
to destroy whatever was most valuable
in society, the authors wished to contribute
their efforts in stemming the torrents of
Jacobinism in America, and resolved to render
the 'Echo' subservient to that purpose.
They therefore proceeded to attack, as
proper objects of satire, those tenets, as absurd
in politics as pernicious in morals, the
visionary scheme of equality, and the baleful
doctrine that sanctions the pursuit of a
good end by the most flagitious means."</p>

<p>Webster's judgment of the condition of
literature in the country at a time when he
was seeking to live by it is contained in a
frank statement which he makes in one of
his letters to Dr. Priestley. That philosopher
had addressed certain letters to the
inhabitants of Northumberland, in which he
undertook to lecture them as a philosophical
and wise Englishman might properly
lecture the citizens of a young and inexperienced
republic. Webster replied in ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
letters and a postscript, which were collected
into a pamphlet and published at New Haven,
in 1800. He contends throughout that
Dr. Priestley did not know his countrymen,
and especially that he was ignorant of New
England; he corrects his political judgments,
but admits the force in general of
his social and literary criticisms. The picture
which Webster draws of the condition
of America at the beginning of the century
is instructive, and explains, indeed, much of
his own career:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I agree with you fully that our colleges
are disgracefully destitute of books and philosophical
apparatus, and that a duty on
books without discrimination is highly impolitic.
Very many of the best authors
cannot be printed in the United States for
half a century or more; and I am ashamed
to own that scarcely a branch of science
can be fully investigated in America for
want of books, especially original works.
This defect of our libraries I have experienced
myself in searching for materials for
the history of Epidemic Diseases.</p>

<p>"In regard to the state of learning in
general, your remarks are not sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
discriminating. You say there is 'less
knowledge in America than in most of the
countries of Europe.' The truth seems to
be that in the Eastern States knowledge is
more diffused among the laboring people
than in any country on the globe. The
learning of the people extends to a knowledge
of their own tongue, of writing and
arithmetic sufficient to keep their own simple
accounts; they read not only the Bible
and newspapers, but almost all read the
best English authors, as the 'Spectator,'
'Rambler,' and the works of Watts, Doddridge,
and many others. If you can find
any country in Europe where this is done
to the same extent as in New England, I
am very ill informed.</p>

<p>"But in the higher branches of literature
our learning is superficial to a shameful degree.
Perhaps I ought to except the science
of law, which, being the road to political
life, is probably as well understood as in
Great Britain; and ethics and political
science have been greatly cultivated since
the American Revolution. On political subjects
I have no hesitation in saying that I
believe the learning of our eminent states<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>men
to be superior to that of most European
writers, and their opinions more correct.
They have all the authors on these
subjects, united with much experience,
which no European country can have had.
This has enabled our statesmen to correct
many of the theories which lead astray
European writers.</p>

<p>"But as to classical learning, history,
civil and ecclesiastical, mathematics, astronomy,
chymistry, botany, and natural history,
excepting here and there a rare instance
of a man who is eminent in some one
of these branches, we may be said to have
no learning at all, or a mere smattering.
And what is more distressing to me, I see
everywhere a disposition to decry the ancient
and original authors, which I deem far
superior to the modern, and from which the
best modern writers have drawn the finest
parts of their productions.</p>

<p>"There is another circumstance still more
afflictive to a man who is attached, as I am,
to a republican government, and one that
I perceive has not occurred to you. This
is that the equal distribution of estates and
the small property of our citizens, both of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
which seem connected with our form of government,
if not essential to it, actually tend
to depress the sciences. Science demands
leisure and money. Our citizens have property
only to give their sons a four years'
education, a time scarcely sufficient to give
them a relish for learning, and far inadequate
to wide and profound researches. As
soon as a young man has closed this period
of study, and while he is at the beginning
of the alphabet of science, he must betake
himself to a profession, he must hurry
through a few books,&mdash;which, by the way,
are rarely original works, but compilations
and abridgments,&mdash;and then must enter
upon practice, and get his living as well as
he can. And as to libraries, we have no such
things. There are not more than three or
four tolerable libraries in America, and these
are extremely imperfect. Great numbers of
the most valuable authors have not found
their way across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"But if our young men had more time
to read, their estates will not enable them
to purchase the books requisite to make a
learned man. And this inconvenience, resulting
from our government and the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of society, I know not how to remedy. As
this, however, is the government to which
you are attached, you will certainly do us a
great service if you can devise a plan for
avoiding its disadvantages. And I can further
inform you that any application to legislatures
for money will be unsuccessful.
The utmost we can do is to squeeze a little
money occasionally from the public treasuries
to furnish buildings and a professor
or two. But as to libraries, public or private,
men who do not understand their value
will be the last to furnish the means of procuring
them. Besides, our rage for gain absorbs
all other considerations; science is a
secondary object, and a man who has grown
suddenly from a dunghill, by a fortunate
throw of the die, avoids a man of learning
as you would a tiger. There are exceptions
to this remark, and some men of taste, here
and there scattered over our country, adorn
the sciences and the moral virtues....</p>

<p>"If the Americans are yet in their leading-strings
as to some parts of literature,
there is the more room for improvement;
and I am confident that the genius of my
fellow-citizens will not be slack in the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>portant
work. You will please to recollect,
sir, that during one hundred and sixty years
of our childhood we were in our nonage;
respecting our parent and looking up to her
for books, science, and improvements. From
her we borrowed much learning and some
prejudices, which time alone can remove.
And be assured, Dr. Priestley, that the
parent is yet to derive some scientific improvements
from the child. Some false
theories, some errors in science, which the
British nation has imbibed from illustrious
men, and nourished from an implicit reliance
on their authority, are to be prostrated
by the penetrating genius of America."</p>

<p>It is plain that Webster, aware of the deficiencies
of his country in learning, was not
rendered entirely submissive by his knowledge,
and was not at all disposed to accept
the relation of pupilage as a permanent one.
He worked with such material as he had,
and as a part of the intellectual movement
of the day brought for his contribution both
industry and an elastic hope.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL WRITINGS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that a man who made a
spelling-book could be a patriot in making
it; it is easy to believe that a patriot in
Webster's day could be a very active participant
in public affairs. There was as yet
no marked political class; every man of
education was expected to write, talk, and
act in politics, and Webster's temperament
and education were certain to make him interested
and active. He began very early
to have a hand in those letters to newspapers
which preceded the editorial article of
the modern newspaper. The printer of a
newspaper was substantially its editor, and
was likely to be a man engaged in public
affairs, but his paper was less the medium
for his own views than a convenient vehicle
for carrying the opinions and arguments of
lawyers, ministers, and others.</p>

<p>Webster began contributing to the "Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>necticut
Courant," published in Hartford,
as early as 1780, his first contribution being
some remarks on Benedict Arnold's letter of
October 7th to the inhabitants of America.
He wrote again the next week on Arnold's
treason, and for the next four or five years
was an occasional contributor upon subjects
of finance, banking, the pay of soldiers, congressional
action, events of the war, and
copyright. "In 1783," he writes of himself,
"the discontents in Connecticut, excited
by an opposition to the grant of five
years' extra pay to the officers of the army,
became alarming, and two thirds of the
towns sent delegates to a convention in Middletown
to devise measures to prevent the
resolve of Congress from being carried into
execution. I then commenced my career
as a political writer, devoting weeks and
months to support the resolves of Congress....
Of the discontents in Connecticut in
1783, which threatened a commotion, there
is no account in any of the histories of the
United States,&mdash;not even in Marshall's,&mdash;except
a brief account in my history; the
present generation being entirely ignorant
of the events. The history of this whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
period, from the peace of 1783 to the adoption
of the Constitution, is, in all the histories
for schools, except mine, a barren,
imperfect account; although it was a period
of great anxiety, when it was doubtful
whether anarchy or civil war was to be our
fate."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This was written in 1838, when Webster
was eighty years old. The character of
that interregnum of 1783-1789 is more
generally recognized now; and it is interesting
to see how an old man, recalling his
earliest entrance into public life, emphasizes
the service which he rendered upon the side
of good government. By early associations,
and by the predilections of a mind which
inherited a large share of Anglo-Saxon political
sense, Webster was from the first a
Federalist in politics. In 1785 he published
a pamphlet entitled "Sketches of American
Policy," which he always claimed was the
first public plea for a government to take
the place of the Confederation, under which
the war had been carried on. He held a
correspondence with Mr. Madison, in 1805,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for the purpose of substantiating this claim,
since it had recently been asserted that the
federal government sprang from Hamilton's
thought. Mr. Madison very temperately and
sensibly wrote to Webster:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The change in our government, like
most other important improvements, ought
to be ascribed rather to a series of causes
than to any particular and sudden one, and
to the participation of many rather than to
the efforts of a single agent. It is certain
that the general idea of revising and enlarging
the scope of the federal authority,
so as to answer the necessary purposes of
the Union, grew up in many minds, and by
natural degrees, during the experienced inefficacy
of the old Confederation. The discernment
of General Hamilton must have
rendered him an early patron of the idea.
That the public attention was called to it
by yourself at an early period is well
known."</p>

<p>We are not especially concerned with
Webster's claim except as it illustrates his
character and activity. He was a busy-body,
if I may recover to better uses a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>somewhat ignoble word. We have seen
him traveling back and forth, visiting the
state capitals and public men in behalf of
his "Grammatical Institute," lecturing and
writing, projecting magazines, and putting
himself into the midst of whatever was going
on. The air was full of political talk,
and Webster was the conductor that drew
off some of it. He rushed eagerly into
pamphlet-writing, both because he had something
to say, and because he never stepped
back to see if any one else was about to say
it. He had no public character to preserve,
and he issued his pamphlet as he delivered
his sentiments upon many subjects,&mdash;to
whomever he might catch. He carried it
to Mount Vernon and put it into the hands
of General Washington, and Madison saw
it there. The nickname of the Monarch,
which Belknap and Hazard gave him, fitted
a young man of aggressive self-confidence,
who saw no reason why he should not have
his say upon the subject which was upper-most
in men's minds, and used the means
most natural to him and most convenient.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton was but a year older
than Noah Webster, and was indeed a much
younger man when he first took part in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
discussion of public affairs. Hamilton was
a man with a genius for statesmanship; in
Webster we see very significantly marks of
political common sense, the presence of
which in the American mind at that day
made Hamilton's leadership possible. It
would be hard to find a better illustration
of the average political education of Americans
of the time than is shown by Webster
in this pamphlet and in other of his writings.
We are accustomed sometimes to
speak of the Constitution as a half-miraculous
gift to the American people, and
to look with exceptional reverence upon
the framers of that instrument. Well, that
mind is on the whole quite as sound as the
contemptuous tone taken by Von Holst
when he affirms that "the Constitution had
been extorted from the grinding necessity
of a reluctant people."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In these words,
however, Von Holst himself scarcely does
justice to his own convictions, and they are
rather an extreme form of protest against
an extravagant adulation of the Constitution.
Better instruments on paper have
been drawn and applied to conditions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
society which were fatal to their efficacy;
but the calling of the convention, the framing
of the Constitution, and the final adoption
were possible because in the community
at large the ideas of freedom and of
self-government had already been formulated
in local institutions for generations,
and for generations had been moulding the
character of the popular thought. The
towns, the parishes, the boroughs, of the
early colonies were the inheritors of communal
ideas which had filtered from Germanic
free communities through English parishes;
under the favoring conditions of a new
world and its unchecked enterprise they
had become political units of great integrity.
The colonies, with their local government,
modified rather than controlled by royal or
proprietary influence, had already learned
many lessons of autonomy: the period of
the war had confirmed these several powers,
and the conclusion of the war found them
still in possession of their interior organic
life, and lacking only that sovereignty which
they had resisted and overthrown. But the
state life was incomplete: there was an absence
of a solid sovereignty in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
States could rest, and the political thought
of the independent colonies required for its
final fulfillment the depositary of national
consciousness which the King and Parliament
had been, but could no longer be.
It was the working out of this practical
political thought which issued in the Constitution
and central government, and it was
possible to be worked out only because
there had been generations of Americans
trained in political life.</p>

<p>Webster was one of these men. He was
the product of the forces which had been at
work in the country from the earliest days.
English freedom, which had forced its ways
to these shores, had grown and increased
under the fostering care of self-government
and native industry. He had been born
and brought up in a New England country
village, the type of the freest and most determinate
local government; he had been
educated at a democratic college; he had
shouldered his musket in a war for the defense
not of his State alone, but of his country,
vague and ill defined though its organic
form might be. When, therefore, the
war was over, and the country was free and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
compelled to manage its own affairs, he
was qualified to take part in that management,
and his temper led him to look for
fundamental grounds of conduct.</p>

<p>His "Sketches of American Policy" thus
interests us as the political thinking of a
young American, of lively disposition, candid
mind, and rash confidence. It could not
help being a reflection of other literature
and thought; but its best character is in
its sturdy and resolute assertion of English
freedom as requiring a central authority in
which to rest. It is curious, in the opening
pages, to see how, in his theories of government,
he is led away by the popular and
alluring philosophy of Rousseau and Rousseau's
interpreter, Jefferson. When he undertakes
to explain the rationale of government
he is a young man, captivated by the
current mode; when he reaches the immediate,
practical duty he is an Englishman,
speaking to the point, and lighting upon the
one unanswerable demand of American
political life at the time. In the earlier
pages of his "Sketches" he lays down his
Theory of Government, which is, in brief,
that of the <i>contrat social</i>, but presented in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
a homely form, which brings it nearer to the
actual life of men; he concludes his observation
with a definition of the most perfect
practicable system of government as "a
government where the right of <i>making</i> laws
is vested in the greatest number of individuals,
and the power of <i>executing</i> them in
the smallest number." "In large communities,"
he adds, "the individuals are too
numerous to assemble for the purpose of
legislation: for which reason, the people
appear by substitutes or agents,&mdash;persons
of their own choice. A representative democracy
seems, therefore, to be the most
perfect system of government that is practicable
on earth." He finds no such government
on the Continent of Europe, or in
history; but when he comes to America he
views with satisfaction a state of things
which renders possible the actual fulfillment
of his ideal. "America, just beginning to
exist, has the science and the experience of
all nations to direct her in forming plans of
government." There is an equal distribution
of landed property, freed from the laws
of entail and primogeniture; there is no
standing army, and there is freedom from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
ecclesiastical tyranny; education is general;
there is no artificial rank in society, and
from necessity Americans are not confined
to single lines of industry; but various occupations
will meet in one man. "Knowledge
is diffused and genius roused by the
very situation of America."</p>

<p>From these considerations he proceeds to
lay down a "Plan of Policy for improving
the Advantages and perpetuating the Union
of the American States." This union, he
shows, cannot depend upon a standing army,
upon ecclesiastical authority, or upon the
fear of an external force; it must find its
reason in the constitutions of the States, and
he sees, therefore, the need of a supreme
head, in which the power of all the States
is united. "There must be a supreme
head, clothed with the same power to make
and enforce laws respecting the general
policy of all the States, as the legislatures
of the respective States have to make laws
binding on those States respecting their
own internal police. The truth of this is
taught by the principles of government, and
confirmed by the experience of America.
Without such a head the States cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<i>united</i>, and all attempts to conduct the
measures of the continent will prove but
governmental farces. So long as any individual
State has power to defeat the measures
of the other twelve, our pretended
union is but a name, and our confederation
a cobweb." He illustrates his point by the
analogy of the Constitution of Connecticut.
It is clear that by the head of the Union he
meant the combined executive and legislative
force, which in the Constitution was
vested in the President and Congress. He
recognizes the necessity of an authoritative
head, but he had not in his own mind separated
the powers of government. He clings
fast to the doctrine that all power is vested
in the people, and proceeds from the people,
and he pleads for such a union as may
be analogous to the union of towns in the
State, where the power of all the towns
united is compulsory over the conduct of a
single member. "The general concerns of
the continent may be reduced to a few
heads; but in all the affairs that respect
the whole, Congress must have the same
power to enact laws and compel obedience
throughout the continent as the legislatures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of the several States have in their respective
jurisdictions. If Congress have any
power, they must have the whole power of
the continent. Such a power would not
abridge the sovereignty of each State in
any article relating to its own government.
The internal police of each State would be
still under the sole superintendence of its
legislature. But in a matter that equally
respects all the States no individual State
has more than a thirteenth part of the legislative
authority, and consequently has no
right to decide what measure shall or shall
not take place on the continent. A majority
of the States <i>must</i> decide; our confederation
cannot be permanent unless founded
on that principle; nay, more, the States cannot
be said to be <i>united</i> till such a principle
is adopted in its utmost latitude. If a single
town or precinct could counteract the
will of a whole State, would there be any
government in that State? It is an established
principle in government that the will
of the minority must submit to that of the
majority; and a single State or a minority
of States ought to be disabled to resist the
will of the majority, as much as a town or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
county in any State is disabled to prevent
the execution of a statute law of the legislature.
It is on this principle, and <i>this
alone</i>, that a free State can be governed;
it is on this principle alone that the American
States can exist as a confederacy of
republics. Either the several States must
continue separate, totally independent of
each other, and liable to all the evils of
jealousy, dispute, and civil dissension,&mdash;nay,
liable to a civil war, upon any clashing
of interests,&mdash;or they must constitute
a general head, composed of representatives
from all the States, and vested with the
power of the whole continent to enforce
their decisions. There is no other alternative.
One of these events must inevitably
take place, and the revolution of a few
years will verify the prediction."</p>

<p>In answering possible objections to the
scheme, he rests in the power of the people,
who "forever keep the sole right of legislation
in their own representatives, but divest
themselves wholly of any right to the administration."
He refuses to believe that
there is any danger from centralization so
long as the people use the power which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
vested in them. "These things," he concludes,
"demand our early and careful attention:
a general diffusion of knowledge;
the encouragement of industry, frugality,
and virtue; and a sovereign power at the
head of the States. <i>All</i> are essential to our
peace and prosperity, but on an energetic
continental government principally depend
our tranquillity at home and our respectability
among foreign nations. We ought to
generalize [that is, delocalize] our ideas and
our measures. We ought not to consider
ourselves as inhabitants of a particular State
only, but as <i>Americans</i>, as the common subjects
of a great empire. We cannot and
ought not wholly to divest ourselves of provincial
views and attachments, but we should
subordinate them to the general interests of
the continent. As a member of a family
every individual has some domestic interests;
as a member of a corporation he has
other interests; as an inhabitant of a State
he has a more extensive interest; as a citizen
and subject of the American empire he
has a national interest far superior to all
others. Every relation in society constitutes
some obligations, which are proportional to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the magnitude of the society. A good
prince does not ask what will be for the interest
of a county or small district in his
dominions, but what will promote the prosperity
of his kingdom. In the same manner,
the citizens of this New World should
inquire, not what will aggrandize this town
or that State, but what will augment the
power, secure the tranquillity, multiply the
subjects, and advance the opulence, the dignity,
and the virtues, of the United States.
Self-interest, both in morals and politics, is
and ought to be the ruling principle of mankind;
but this principle must operate in
perfect conformity to social and political obligations.
Narrow views and illiberal prejudices
may for a time produce a selfish system
of politics in each State; but a few
years' experience will correct our ideas of
self-interest, and convince us that a selfishness
which excludes others from a participation
of benefits is, in all cases, self-ruin,
and that <i>provincial</i> interest is inseparable
from <i>national interest</i>."</p>

<p>It will be seen that Webster, though confused
sometimes in his phraseology, and
weak in his philosophy, did see with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
English freeman's political instinct the practical
bearings of his subject, and in his
broad, comprehensive survey disclosed that
large American apprehension of freedom
and nationality which underlay the best
thought of his time. His pamphlet is not
a piece of elegant writing, and it is introduced
by superficial theorizing; but the
practical value is great. Thoughts which
have so entered into our political consciousness
as to be trite and commonplace are
presented as the new possession of a young
man lately from college, and it is fair to
judge of the current speculation of his time
by the results here gathered into logical
order. Webster, as I said before, may be
taken in this pamphlet as an admirable example
of the American political thinker,
who has worked out, under the new conditions
of this continent, ideas and principles
which his ancestors brought from England.
He thinks he has invented something new,
but the worth of his thought is in its experience.
In a period when every one was
engaged in rearranging the universe upon
some improved plan of his own, it is not
surprising that those who thought they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
a brand-new nation on their hands should
have made a serious business of nationalizing
themselves. They thought they were
starting afresh from a purely philosophical
basis, and they were greatly concerned about
their premises; as a matter of fact, their
premises were often highly artificial, while
their conclusions were sound, for these really
drew their life from the historic development
of free institutions, and the nation which was
formally instituted had long had an organic
process. Webster himself, twenty years
after, when referring to this pamphlet, had
the good sense to say, "The remarks in the
first three sketches are general, and some of
them I now believe to be too visionary for
practice; but the fourth sketch was intended
expressly to urge, by all possible arguments,
the necessity of a radical alteration in our
system of general government, and an outline
is there suggested." He adds, "As a
private man, young and unknown, I could
do but little; but that little I did."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1786 he went to Philadelphia
at the invitation of Franklin, and
stayed there a year. He maintained himself
in part by teaching, being master of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Episcopal academy; but his interest centred
upon the debates of the Constitutional
Convention, then in session, and a month
after it rose he published "An Examination
of the Leading Principles of the Federal
Constitution," which was, in effect, a
popular defense of the work of the Convention,
especially as regards the division of
the legislature into two houses. The paper
shows rather zeal and fervor than acuteness,
and seems to have been hastily written
to serve some special and temporary
purpose. It has a magniloquence not elsewhere
found in his writings, as when he
says: "This western world now beholds
an &aelig;ra important beyond conception, and
which posterity will number with the age of
the Czar of Muscovy, and with the promulgation
of the Jewish laws at Mount Sinai.
The names of those men who have digested
a system of constitutions for the American
empire will be enrolled with those of Zamolxis
and Odin, and celebrated by posterity
with the honors which less enlightened
nations have paid to the fabled demi-gods of
antiquity.... In the formation of our
Constitution the wisdom of all ages is col<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>lected;
the legislators of antiquity are consulted,
as well as the opinions and interests
of the millions who are concerned. In short,
it is an empire of reason." In all this there
is a flurry of enthusiasm which was not confined
to Webster.</p>

<p>Later still, in 1793, he was placed in a
more responsible position, as editor of a new
daily newspaper in New York. He had
been writing under the signature of Candor
in the "Courant" upon the French Revolution,
taking a somewhat Gallican position,
when he chanced to meet Genet at dinner
in New York. Conversation with that gentleman
caused a change in his views, and it
was during this visit to New York that Mr.
James Watson proposed to him to establish
a newspaper there in the defense of Washington's
administration. With his ardent
attachment to Washington, and his adhesion
generally to the federal party, he accepted
the invitation, and established the
"American Minerva," which subsequently
became the "New York Commercial Advertiser."
In conducting the paper he introduced
an economical device, which was
novel at the time, but has since become an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
established mode with daily newspapers:
he issued a semi-weekly paper, called the
"Herald," which was made up from the
columns of the daily "Minerva" without
recomposition of type.</p>

<p>The political situation which led to the
establishment of the "Minerva" was that
created by the intrigues of Citizen Genet,
and by the bitter hostility to Washington's
administration on the part of the French
sympathizers. Washington had issued his
proclamation of neutrality, and the Jacobin
clubs had opened upon him with their newspapers
and pamphlets and public addresses
in the most virulent manner. It is scarcely
too much to say that the animosity between
the French and anti-French parties in the
United States was keener&mdash;it certainly was
madder&mdash;than that which had existed between
Americans and Englishmen during
the war which had so lately closed. The
earlier movements of the French Revolution
had called out in America even more
than in England the liveliest expectations
of a golden age. Americans, flattered by
the French alliance and by the reputation
in which their young republic was held,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
were intoxicated with vanity, and filled also
with an eager hope that principles of which
they were standard-bearers were to be dominant
in Europe. The theoretical and <i>doctrinaire</i>
views which seemed for the time to
be justified by the success of the American
people came to stand for universal principles
of reason, capable of bearing all the
weight of human experience, and of serving
in the place of religion. The most enthusiastic,
beholding a new era, were only a
few steps in advance of more cautious men,
and the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in France received the
sympathy not only of Jefferson and Madison,
but of Washington and Hamilton. It
was only when the flood-gates were opened
that the uniform sentiment was broken in
upon, and parties were formed of "Gallo-maniacs"
on one side, as their enemies
called them, and anti-Gallicans on the
other. But this split into two parties had
occurred before Genet arrived, and the
breach was only widened by that head-strong
minister's action. There can be little
doubt that the prudence of Washington,
aided by the conservative Hamilton and the
unwilling Jefferson, saved the country at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the time from committing itself to the insanity
of active co&ouml;peration with the raging
French republic.</p>

<p>The support of the administration was to
be looked for not only in legislatures, but
in the public press, which was rapidly becoming
a power in the country. Certainly
the flames of passion and prejudice were
fanned most persistently by such journalists
as Freneau and Bache on one side, and Cobbett
on the other, and it was evident that
the war over the question was to be fought
largely in the columns of newspapers. Webster's
federalism was staunch, so was his
personal loyalty to Washington; but I think
he was asked to manage the new paper
chiefly because in his writings thus far,
both upon political and general topics, he
had shown himself to have that direct and
homely style which makes itself understood
by the people because it is in the dialect of
the people. At any rate, he began at once
vigorously to write and print articles bearing
upon the great question of the day. He
informed himself of the historical process of
the French Revolution, but whatever he
wrote was in reference to the effect upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the United States. Webster's patriotism was
the best education for a true regard of public
affairs in France. His instinct for unity,
his conception of the future of the United
States, his unbounded faith in American
ideas, all served to make him fight any proposal
which would complicate the United
States with foreign powers.</p>

<p>His hand is seen in various parts of the
paper for the five years during which he
was connected with it. The French Revolution
and all the complications growing
out of it were treated with steadfast reference
to the interests of the United States,
and blows were dealt unceasingly upon the
democratic party, as the anti-Federalists
were beginning to call themselves. Webster
digested the foreign news, wrote articles
and paragraphs, and used the machinery
which belonged to a paper of that day. It
is not unlikely that he wrote letters to himself;
it is certain that he wrote a series of
essays entitled "The Times," pithy, forcible
homilies and comments, expressed generally
in a colloquial form, and intended, evidently,
to be driven home sharply and positively.
I give an extract from one as indicating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
something of the manner of these <i>conciones
ad populum</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>... "Our government is a government
of universal toleration. The freedom of
America, its greatest blessing, secures to
every citizen the right of thinking, of speaking,
of worshiping and acting as he pleases,
provided he does not violate the laws. The
only people in America who have dared to
violate this freedom are the democratical
incendiaries, who have proceeded to threaten
violence to tories and aristocrats and federal
republicans; that is, to people not of their
party. Every threat of this kind is an act
of tyranny; an attempt to abridge the rights
of a fellow-citizen. If a man is persecuted
for his opinions, it is wholly immaterial
whether the persecution springs from one
man or from a society of the people,&mdash;when
men are disposed to persecute. Power is
always right; weakness always wrong.
Power is always insolent and despotic:
whether exercised in throwing its opposers
into a bastile; burning them at the stake;
torturing them on a rack; beheading them
with a guillotine; or taking them off, as at
the massacre of St. Bartholomew, at a gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>eral
sweep. Power is the same in Turkey
as in America. When the will of man is
raised above law, it is always tyranny and
despotism, whether it is the will of a bashaw
or of bastard patriots."</p>

<p>The articles which Webster contributed
in reviewing the historical movement of the
French Revolution were worked over into
a pamphlet, which he published in 1794.
There were other questions belonging to
this time which grew out of the relations
between the young republic and European
nations. In running over the files of the
"Minerva," one is struck with the predominating
influence of Europe in American
affairs. Every change which took place
abroad was watched with reference to its
influence on home politics. The habit of
regarding America as dependent upon Europe,
which underlay so much of the thought
of the time, was not easily laid aside, and
the tests applied to the conduct of American
affairs were of European precedents. The
secretary of state was then and long after
the leading man of the Cabinet. It is indeed
only lately that his comparative importance
has been lessened, and that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
secretaries of the treasury and of the interior
increased.</p>

<p>Webster's pen was employed on the great
questions which arose on the rights of neutral
nations, and especially on the policy
contained in Jay's Treaty. In vindication
of this treaty he published a series of
papers, under the signature of Curtius,
twelve in all, but the sixth and seventh
were contributed by James Kent, afterward
Chancellor Kent. The papers came out at
the same time with the series signed Camillus,
written by Hamilton and King.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> When
the first number of Curtius appeared, Jefferson
wrote of it to Madison: "I send you
by post one of the pieces, Curtius, lest it
should not have come to you otherwise. It
is evidently written by Hamilton, giving a
first and general view of the subject, that
the public mind might be kept a little in
check, till he could resume the subject
more at large from the beginning, under
his second signature, Camillus.... I gave
a copy or two, by way of experiment, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
honest-hearted men of common understanding,
and they were not able to parry the
sophistry of Curtius. I have ceased, therefore,
to give them. Hamilton is really a
colossus to the anti-republican party....
For God's sake, take up your pen, and give
a fundamental reply to Curtius and Camillus."
But Madison did not yield to Jefferson's
entreaty. In these papers Webster
reviewed the treaty article by article, and
kept closely to his text, in the last number
only enlarging upon the insidious character
of much of the opposition to the treaty,
as connected with the machinations of the
French party. It was not without reason
that Mr. King expressed the opinion to Mr.
Jay "that the essays of Curtius had contributed
more than any other papers of the
same kind to allay the discontent and opposition
to the treaty;" assigning as a reason
that they were peculiarly well adapted
to the understanding of the people at large.</p>

<p>Webster had the newspaper faculty, and
was as omniscient as any editor need be.
A consideration of his general labors belongs
elsewhere, but it ought to be noted
here that he was prompt to see the perils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
which underlay American slavery. He discussed
the subject, indeed, chiefly in its industrial
relations, but he regarded these as
affecting parties and national well-being.
As early as 1793 he delivered an address
before the Connecticut Society for the Promotion
of Freedom "On the Effects of Slavery
on Morals and Industry," and shortly
afterward expanded the address into a treatise.
His work bristles with historical illustrations,
for it was the habit then more
than later to draw inferences from foreign
facts; there had not yet accumulated that
great swelling volume of home testimony
which made reference to experience outside
of America unnecessary and rather impertinent.
His remedy for the existing evil is
the elevation of slaves to the rank of tenants,
not in a sudden emancipation, but in
the gradual selection of the most capable,
and he finds his most satisfactory example
in the experiment made thirty years before
by the Chancellor of Poland. The appeal
is not greatly to the conscience, but to the
interest of men. He sums up the argument
at the close with the words: "The industry,
the commerce, and the moral char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>acter
of the United States will be immensely
benefited by the change. Justice
and Humanity require it; Christianity <i>commands</i>
it." He had not long been conducting
the "Minerva" before he took up the
subject again, reminding the public of this
treatise. "In that pamphlet," he says, "I
endeavored to show by arguments and facts
that the labor of slaves is less productive
than that of freemen. A doctrine of this
kind, if clearly and incontrovertibly established,
will perhaps go farther in abolishing
the practice of enslaving men than any declamation
on the immorality and cruelty of
the practice." He then takes up the statistics
which had accumulated since the publication
of his pamphlet, showing in a forcible
manner that the Northern Free States
were steadily gaining on the Southern Slave
States, and carries forward the argument
with great acuteness. "What," he asks,
"has produced this difference in the productiveness
of the labor in the Northern
division? Peace and good markets have
been common to both divisions; and the
laboring people in the Northern States were
as free before the year 1791 as since.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
What, then, has stimulated the industry of
the free laborers since that period? The
answer is obvious. An augmentation of
capital operating upon their free labor. It
is probable there has been an augmentation
of capital throughout the United States,
though I am convinced that augmentation
has been much greater in the Northern than
in the Southern. But my general remark
is that an increase of capital must be felt
by the laboring people themselves to produce
its full effect in stimulating industry.
The benefits of capital and good markets
in the Northern States are experienced by
the men who labor; in the Southern States
this is not the case among the slaves, who
make a great proportion among the laborers.
It is of little consequence to a slave
whether his master employs in business ten
thousand or one thousand, or whether he
gets four dollars or two for a hundred of
tobacco. In both cases he plods on at his
task with the same slow, reluctant pace. A
<i>freeman</i>, on the other hand, labors with
double diligence when he gets a high price
for his produce; and this I apprehend to
be a principal cause which has in the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
two years occasioned such a surprising difference
of exports in favor of the Northern
States."</p>

<p>Webster's connection with the "Minerva"
continued for about five years, when
he abandoned it as unprofitable; but his industry
may be inferred from the fact that
his writings upon the paper, inclusive of
translations from foreign languages, would
amount to twenty octavo volumes.</p>

<p>His withdrawal from the conduct of a
daily newspaper did not mean his indifference
to public affairs. Near the close of his
stay in New York he wrote "A Letter on
the Value and Importance of the American
Commerce to Great Britain, addressed to a
Gentleman of Distinction in London." His
aim was to emphasize the judgment that
the commercial interests of the two countries
were closely interwoven, and that in
the complication of European politics the
United States, if compelled to make any
alliance, was most naturally related to England.
In 1802 he published his laborious
and learned "Essay on the Rights of Neutral
Nations," in which he took a position at
variance on a single point with that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
he held when vindicating Jay's Treaty a few
years before. In that treaty Great Britain
had stipulated that naval stores should be
prohibited as contraband of war, and Webster,
in common with others, assumed with
reluctance that such prohibition was in accordance
with the general law of nations,
although admitting that this was the most
vulnerable article of the treaty. Further
investigation satisfied him of his error, and
he frankly avowed it in the later essay, where
he says: "For the honor of my country,
and the essential interests of her commerce,
I regret that the administration, in the very
commencement of the national government,
has consented to abandon ground which the
nations of Europe had, for more than a
century, been struggling to obtain and to
fortify. I have no hesitation in declaring
that no considerations of public danger can
justify a commercial nation in consenting
to enlarge the field of contraband; nor can
there be an apology for the renewal of the
clause in the compact, by which our true
interests and essential rights have been
surrendered." Following the maxim that
"Free ships make free goods," he estab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>lishes
himself on the proposition that
"neutrals have a better right to trade than
nations have to fight and plunder." Webster
argued strenuously in maintenance of
rights which were in jeopardy, and the
disregard of which by Great Britain had
much to do with the War of 1812-1814.
He was writing at the beginning of Jefferson's
first administration, with all the distrust
which the federalist party felt of the
President's foreign policy, but it cannot be
said that his examination of the subject is
other than fair and impartial.</p>

<p>How bitterly he could write as a partisan
is shown by the long "Address to the
President of the United States on the subject
of his Address," published in 1802, and
called out by Jefferson's inaugural, then six
months old. The principles laid down in
that address, in the midst of much fine
rhetoric, had begun to be shown in practice,
and Webster employs argument and invective
to lay bare the falseness of Jefferson's
professions. His longest and sharpest attack
is upon the policy pursued by the President
in rewarding his followers with office,&mdash;a
policy in accord with the principles laid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
down in the inaugural. We are accustomed
nowadays to strong statements of
the viciousness of the spoils system, but no
advocate of civil service reform has attacked
the full-grown system of party rewards
with any more vigor than Webster
showed at the beginning of the system.
"No, sir!" he exclaims indignantly, "no
individual or party has a <i>claim</i> or <i>right</i> to
any office whatever;" and he shows with
exceeding clearness the tendency of such a
doctrine. In his subsequent occasional addresses
one finds frequently the note of alarm
here struck. Webster was a fervid Federalist,
and the accession of the democratic
party to power was a shock to his confidence
in the perpetuity of the Union from
which he never wholly recovered. When
the election for President occurred in 1832,
and it was clear that Jackson would be returned,
Webster refused to go to the polls;
he sent away the carriage which came for
him. Of what use was it to vote? But the
next year, when his son-in-law, Judge Ellsworth,
was a candidate for the governor's
place, his faith revived a little, and he
found it possible to vote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster's federalism had one significant
expression in the preliminary measures
which led to the Hartford Convention. In
January, 1814, Judge Joseph Lyman, of
Northampton, wrote to him at Amherst,
where he was then living, and proposed a
meeting of the most discreet and intelligent
inhabitants of the county of Hampshire, for
the purpose of a free and dispassionate discussion
respecting public concerns. A meeting
was held in Northampton, January 19th,
at which Webster proposed that the several
towns in the vicinity should call a convention
of delegates from the legislatures of
the Northern States, to agree upon and urge
certain amendments to the Constitution for
the restoration of the equilibrium between
the North and the South. He and two
others were appointed to draft a circular
letter, and this circular, written by Webster,
was sent out under Judge Lyman's
name. In consequence of the appeal, a
number of towns sent petitions to the General
Court of Massachusetts asking for such
a convention. It was not judged expedient
to call one at that session; but in October
of the same year Harrison Gray Otis reintro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>duced
the measure, and Mr. Webster, then
a member of the legislature, supported it in
a speech. The Hartford Convention thereupon
was called, and while Mr. Webster
was not a member of it, he was so far involved
in its organization that he afterward
published a sketch of these earlier steps,
though he did not there state in full his
own intimate connection with the movement.</p>

<p>Webster's federalism was something more
than a partisan sentiment. In following his
political thought, it is easily perceived that
his creed of party was subordinate to his
larger belief in the American Republic. His
writings upon public affairs, which are very
considerable, constantly reveal this dominant
thought. The very vagaries&mdash;which,
as we have seen, and shall see again, rendered
some of his ideas amusing and vain-glorious&mdash;were
but the disorderly and ill-regulated
whims of a sincere patriotism.
Americanism in literature and language
may become fantastic, but in politics there
is pretty sure to be room for the most ardent
love of country to expand itself without becoming
a bubble, and it is certain that Web<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ster's
political writings were marked by a
largeness of conception and a clear understanding
of national lines which redeem
them from insignificance. They had their
influence upon his contemporaries, yet they
were, after all, ephemeral. Had he concentrated
his powers upon political themes, it
is not impossible that he should have been
a journalist, for instance, of influence and
even celebrity. But there was a weakness
on this side. He did not bring to the discussion
of great public questions that weight
of learning and breadth of argument which
will sustain political writings when the
immediate occasion has passed. Whether
writing pamphlets or newspaper articles,
he was essentially a writer of the day, of
importance in pressing home arguments
calling for immediate results, but lacking
the art of literature and the commanding
thought of a statesman. He had a true sentiment
in politics, and he was able also to
see practical issues clearly; but his mind was
analytical rather than constructive, and his
restlessness of life was indicative of a certain
instability of temper which kept him
uneasily employed about many things rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
than steadfast and single-minded. It would
be too much to say that he failed as a political
writer, and fell back on his philological
and school-master studies; yet it is very
likely that, in the various excursions which
he made into politics and general literature,
he discovered by successive trials that there
was one pursuit more than all which really
belonged to him, and the constancy with
which he followed it is in singular contrast
with the multitudinous experiments which
seemed to occupy the period of his life
between 1785 and 1802.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>EXCURSIONS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of his political papers Webster
sketches the average American of his time:
"He makes a variety of utensils,&mdash;rough,
indeed, but such as will answer his purpose;
he is a husbandman in summer and a mechanic
in winter; he travels about the country;
he converses with a variety of professions;
he reads public papers; he has access
to a parish library, and thus becomes acquainted
with history and politics, and every
man in New England is a theologian." I
have already intimated that Webster dissipated
his strength, and it is only fair to state
the facts in the light of the conditions under
which he lived. In the unorganized and fluent
state of society there was little room for
a specialist; or, to change the phrase for a
more exact one, there was too much room.
Every educated man was called upon to occupy
himself with a great variety of tasks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The demand made by the republican experiment
was very great. People had practiced
local self-government under monarchical supervision
for a long time; now they were
bound to extend the sphere of their political
activity, and in the adjustment of the
new machinery there was abundant opportunity
for all the ingenuity and wit of the
educated class to exercise itself. Then there
was a great impetus given by politics to the
democratizing of the nation, and, in the
rapid social changes of the day, the educated
class found itself well shaken up with the
mechanic. The terms which Webster employs
of the average American may easily
be applied to all classes. Nice distinctions
of rank and occupation could not easily be
maintained in a country where there was
vastly more land than could be tilled, where
enterprise of every kind was limited only
by lack of labor, and where every citizen
had his hand on the wheels of government.</p>

<p>In a conventional way Webster would be
classed amongst the educated men of the
country: he had received his diploma at one
of the chief colleges; his occupations were
intellectual; his profession was the liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
one of the law. Yet in a more real way he
was a farmer's son, and though he ceased
early from manual labor his mental affiliations
were with the plain people rather than
with the intellectual ones. He seized all
subjects by their practical side, and his instinct
was to apply the rough-and-ready
rules of common sense to all questions,
whether of politics, theology, or philology.
Such men as Belknap and Hazard looked
with disdain upon him; they felt rather than
said that Webster was not one of them. So,
when living in Hartford, Webster was not
identified with the circle of Hartford wits.
His mind was not subtle or graceful; he
had not the faculty of creating, nor, so far
as I can discover, of appreciating literature;
but he had an uncommonly active manufacturing
mind, and in his intellectual workshop
he made, as he said of his average
American, "a variety of utensils,&mdash;rough,
indeed, but such as will answer his purpose."</p>

<p>He had much in common with Franklin,
to whom he was strongly drawn. He had
Franklin's eminent common sense and homeliness,
by which he gained a hearing from
plain men and women; but he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Franklin's crystal style, his instinct for
the fewest and best words, his happy use
of a language which seemed made for his
thoughts. We noticed that in the spelling-book
he displayed a fondness for the wisdom
of proverbs and familiar sayings, and
among his earliest writings were a series of
pithy homilies to the people upon questions
of morals and manners, published first in
the Connecticut "Courant," but early collected
into a volume entitled "The Prompter;"
a little book which one may trace to a
good many different printing-offices and to
various sections of the country, certainly the
most widely spread of Webster's writings,
after his text-books, and the most worthy of
a repeated life. If I am not mistaken, it is
even now making its little mark on character.</p>

<p>The sub-title of the book is "A Commentary
on Common Sayings and Subjects,
which are full of Common Sense,&mdash;the best
sense in the world;" and in the preface, explanatory
of the purpose of the book, Webster's
manner as a popular writer is well
shown. "A Prompter," he remarks of the
happy title, "is the man who, in plays, sits
behind the scenes, looks over the rehearser,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and with a moderate voice corrects him when
wrong, or assists his recollection when he forgets
the next sentence. A Prompter, then,
says but little, but that little is very necessary,
and often does much good. He helps
the actors on the stage at a dead lift, and
enables them to go forward with spirit and
propriety. The writer of this little book
took it into his head to prompt the numerous
actors upon the great theatre of life;
and he sincerely believes that his only motive
was to do good. He cast about to find
the method of writing calculated to do the
most general good. He wanted to whip
vice and folly out of the country; he
thought of 'Hudibras' and 'McFingal,'
and pondered well whether he should attempt
the masterly style of those writings.
He found this would not do, for, like most
modern rhymers, he is no poet, and he always
makes bungling work at imitation.</p>

<p>"The Prompter thought of the grave diction
of sober, moral writers, and the pompous,
flowing style of modern historians.
Fame began now to prick up his vanity to
try an imitation of the great Dr. Robertson,
Dr. Johnson, and Mr. Gibbon, those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
giants of literature. He thought if he
could muster dollars enough to buy a style-mill,
which those heroes of science undoubtedly
used to cut out sentences for their
works, he should succeed to a tittle. But
then it occurred to him that when he had
cut and shaped his periods into exact
squares, diamonds, pentagons, parallelograms,
and other mathematical figures, they
might not contain very clear, precise, definite
ideas; one half of his readers would not
understand him. The style-mill, then, or,
as some people contemptuously call it, the
word-mill, would not answer the Prompter's
purpose of doing as much good as possible
by making men wiser and better.</p>

<p>"At length he determined to have nothing
to do with a brilliant flow of words, a
pompous elegance of diction; for what has
the world to do with the sound of words?
The Prompter's business is with the world
at large, and the mass of mankind are concerned
only with common things. A dish
of high-seasoned turtle is rarely found; it
sometimes occurs at a gentleman's table,
and then the chance is it produces a surfeit.
But good solid roast beef is a common dish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
for all men; it sits easy on the stomach, it
supports, it strengthens and invigorates.
Vulgar sayings and proverbs, so much despised
by the literary epicures, the Chesterfields
of the age, are the roast beef of
science. They contain the experience, the
wisdom, of nations and ages compressed into
the compass of a nutshell. To crack the
shell and extract the contents to feed those
who have appetites is the aim of this little
book."</p>

<p>The several essays are expansive of the
familiar sayings or proverbs which stand for
their titles, as, "It will do for the present,"
"I told you so," "He is sowing his wild
oats," "He would have his own way," "A
stitch in time saves nine," "Any other time
will do as well," "He has come out at the
little end of the horn." The papers are all
short, and no time is wasted in coming at
the point; indeed, there is a succession of
thrusts in each paper, and the reader is
prodded more or less efficiently at each step.
Here, to give a single example, is Number
XVIII.: "What is everybody's business is
nobody's."</p>

<p>"The consequence is that everybody and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
nobody are just the same thing,&mdash;a truth
most pointedly exemplified in the kitchen
of a Southern nabob. 'Phil!' says the mistress,
with the air of an empress. Phil appears.
'Go tell Peg to tell Sue to come
along here and pick up a needle.' 'Yes,
ma'am,' answers Phil, and waddles back
like a duck. 'Peg, mistress says you must
tell Sue to go to her and pick up a needle.'
Peg carries the message to Sue, but Sue is
busy cleaning a candlestick. 'Well,' says
Sue, 'I will go as soon as I have done.'
The mistress wants the needle; she waits
ten or fifteen minutes, grows impatient.
'Phil, did you tell Peg what I told you?'
'Ye&mdash;s, ma'am,' says Phil, drawling out
her answer. 'Well, why don't the jade
do what I told her? Peg, come here, you
hussy! Did you tell Sue what Phil told
you?' 'Yes, ma'am.' 'Well, why don't
the lazy trollop come along? Here I am
waiting for the needle! Tell the jade to
come instantly!'</p>

<p>"Risum teneatis? Hold, my readers
don't know Latin; but can you help laughing,
my friends? Laugh, then, at the Southern
nabob, with twenty fat slaves in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
kitchen,&mdash;laugh well at him, for there is
cause enough; then come <i>home</i> and laugh.</p>

<p>"You want a good school, perhaps, and
so do your neighbors. But whose business
is it to find a teacher, a house, etc.? 'John,
I wish you would speak to William to ask
Joseph to desire our friend Daniel to set
about getting a good school. We want one
very much; it is a shame to us to be so
negligent.' This is the last we hear of the
good school. <i>What is everybody's business
is nobody's.</i></p>

<p>"You want to collect the public taxes
into the treasury of the State. The towns
choose constables or collectors of taxes. No
security is taken for a faithful discharge of
the trust, but a law is passed, which says,
like the mistress to her wenches, Treasurer,
do you tell the constable to collect and pay
over the taxes. The collector, like the nabob's
slave, has no motive for diligence; he
gets not half enough for collecting to pay
for his horse-flesh. He lounges about a year
or two, squanders away the money, and
where is his bondsman? The town! Right,
the town is his bondsman. The law says,
Treasurer, do you issue your execution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
against the sheriff, and command him to
levy upon the constable, who is not worth
a farthing; get a return of <i>non est inventus</i>;
then levy upon his bondsman, the town;
take the estate of everybody, post it for sale,
get it receipted and not delivered; sue the
receipts-man, get the money, make the town
pay it twice,&mdash;27,000l. in arrears! It is a
shame! Oh, such a bustle with Mr. Everybody,
and all to pick up a needle! The
State is like the nabob's family. 'Phil, tell
Peg to tell Sue to pick up the needle.'</p>

<p>"Now in fact it is a very easy thing to
pick up a needle, but if one cannot stoop
to pick it up another ought to be paid for
it. One servant who is paid for his work
will pick up more needles than twenty fat,
lounging slaves that think it a drudgery
and get nothing for it.</p>

<p>"It would be a good thing for a State to
know that <i>everybody's business is nobody's</i>.
Every man in Connecticut is responsible for
a faithful collection of public money; then
it is nobody's business. The Prompter
never saw a watch with two mainsprings,
much less with two hundred. One spring
is enough, and that government, the execu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>tive
of which depends on many springs, will
jar, clash, stop, and be always out of order,&mdash;27,000l.
in arrears.</p>

<p>"Appoint one collector, the treasurer;
make him answerable for the collection of
the whole state revenue. Let him appoint
his deputies; let them be few, but let them
be paid. All the difficulty will vanish; one
spring will move the whole; the state treasury,
like the federal, will be supplied; no arrears
then, no levying executions on towns."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This happens to have its application to
public affairs; most of the twenty-eight
papers have their special point in personal
character. The writing is not elegant; it is
sometimes ungrammatical; but it is intelligible,
and with its bluntness could hardly
fail to make itself felt. It is when one compares
it with similar work of Franklin's, as
"The Whistle," for example, that one is reminded
of its inartistic form. But Webster
was always busy over subjects directly connected
with the well-being of the people.
His philological work had its origin in this
motive, and in his miscellaneous writings
he displayed his practical philosophy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
philanthropy. He wrote frequently upon
banks and banking; his "Epidemic and
Pestilential Diseases" is pronounced by an
authority to have great historical value;
he was one of the founders of the Connecticut
Academy of Arts and Sciences; and
in the numerous list of his writings one
comes upon such oddly assorted subjects as
an account of a tornado in Wethersfield,
a cure for cancer, upon white-washing, the
mental arithmetic of a negro, on winds,
upon female education, on the decomposition
of white-lead paint, a dissertation on
the supposed change in the temperature of
winter, upon names of streets in New York,
on yellow fever, on the age of literary
men, and one article with the suggestive
title "Number of Deaths in the Episcopal
Church in New York in each Month
for Ten Years." He had a passion for statistics
which took an odd turn. In his diary
one constantly finds an enumeration of the
houses in the town which he happens to
be visiting. "During his brief residence
in New York," says one biographical sketch,
"Mr. Webster numbered the houses in the
city, and found that they were thirty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
hundred." He would count up one side of a
street and down the other, and place the results
in his note-book. I think he published
in some paper the record of this individual
census as applied to a number of houses
and villages. There must have been in his
constitution an inordinate love of detail,
intensified, perhaps, by much contemplation
of those battalions of words which make
his spelling-book pages look like spiritual
armies marching against ignorance.</p>

<p>We have already observed Webster's interest
in political discussion, and have tried
to disclose something of his temper when
viewing questions of public policy. "The
Prompter" was written with reference to the
conduct of life in individuals, but, as in the
paper copied above, there is constant regard
to the American character, and to the
manner in which one should conduct himself
in the new conditions of American life.
The general subject of Americanism was
one upon which he was constantly writing.
We shall see later the length to which he
carried his views in relation to the American
language; here we may note some of
the directions which his thought took when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
dealing with what may be called the greater
morals of national life. In his "Remarks on
the Manners, Government, and Debt of the
United States," an odd combination of subjects,
apparently, but very closely connected
in Webster's mind, he undertakes to discover
the cause of some of the political evils
of the day, and is led by his subject into
regions lying outside of politics.</p>

<p>"A fundamental mistake of the Americans
has been that they considered the revolution
as completed, when it was but just
begun. Having raised the pillars of the
building, they ceased to exert themselves,
and seemed to forget that the whole super-structure
was then to be erected. This
country is independent in government, but
totally dependent in manners, which are the
basis of government. Men seem not to attend
to the difference between Europe and
America in point of age and improvement,
and are disposed to rush with heedless emulation
into an imitation of manners for which
we are not prepared....</p>

<p>"The present ambition of Americans is
to introduce as fast as possible the fashionable
amusements of the European courts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Considering the former dependence of America
on England, her descent, her connection
and present intercourse, this ambition cannot
surprise us. But it must check this
ambition to reflect on the consequences. It
will not be denied that there are vices predominant
in the most polite cities in Europe
which are not only unknown, but are
seldom mentioned, in America, and vices
that are infamous beyond conception. I
presume it will not be denied that there
must be an amazing depravation of mind
in a nation where a farce is a publication of
more consequence than Milton's poem, and
where an opera dancer, or an Italian singer,
receives a salary equal to that of an ambassador.
The facts being known and acknowledged,
I presume the consequence will not
be denied. Not that the charge is good
against every individual; even in the worst
times there will be found many exceptions
to the general character of a nation....</p>

<p>"In some Asiatic countries people never
change their mode of dress. This uniformity,
which continues for ages, proceeds from
the same principles as the monthly changes
in England and France; both proceed from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
necessity and policy. Both arise from good
causes which operate in the several governments;
that is, the manners of each government
are subservient to its particular interest.
The reverse is true of this country.
Our manners are wholly subservient to the
interest of foreign nations. Where do we
find, in dress or equipage, the least reference
to the circumstances of this country?
Is it not the sole ambition of the Americans
to be just like other nations, without the
means of supporting the resemblance? We
ought not to harbor any spleen or prejudice
against foreign kingdoms. This would be
illiberal. They are wise, they are respectable.
We should despise the man that
piques himself on his own country, and
treats all others with indiscriminate contempt.
I wish to see much less jealousy
and ill-nature subsisting between the Americans
and English. But in avoiding party
spirit and resentment on the one hand, we
should be very careful of servility on the
other. There is a manly pride in true independence
which is equally remote from
insolence and meanness,&mdash;a pride that is
characteristic of great minds. Have Amer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>icans
discovered this pride since the declaration
of peace? We boast of independence,
and with propriety. But will not the same
men who glory in this great event, even in
the midst of a gasconade, turn to a foreigner,
and ask him, 'What is the latest
fashion in Europe?' He has worn an elegant
suit of clothes for six weeks; he might
wear it a few weeks longer, but it has not
so many buttons as the last suit of my Lord
----. He throws it aside, and gets one that
has. The suit costs him a sum of money;
but it keeps him in the fashion, and feeds
the poor of Great Britain or France. It is
a singular phenomenon, and to posterity it
will appear incredible, that a nation of heroes,
who have conquered armies and raised
an empire, should not have the spirit to say,
<i>We will wear our clothes as we please</i>.</p>

<p>"Let it not be thought that this is a trifling
subject, a matter of no consequence.
Mankind are governed by opinion; and
while we flatter ourselves that we enjoy independence
because no foreign power can
impose laws upon us, we are groaning beneath
the tyranny of opinion,&mdash;a tyranny
more severe than the laws of monarchs; a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
dominion, voluntary, indeed, but, for that
reason, more effectual; an authority of manners,
which commands our services, and
sweeps away the fruits of our labor.</p>

<p>"I repeat the sentiment with which I began,&mdash;the
Revolution of America is yet
incomplete. We are now in a situation to
answer all the purposes of the European nations,&mdash;independent
in government, and
dependent in manners. They give us their
fashions; they direct our taste to make a
market for their commodities; they engross
the profits of our industry, without the hazard
of defending us, or the expense of supporting
our civil government. A situation
more favorable to their interest or more repugnant
to our own they could not have
chosen for us, nor we embraced."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Every man in New England is a theologian,"
says Webster in the passage quoted
at the head of this chapter, and Webster
himself was no exception to his statement.
He published in "The Panoplist," and afterward
in pamphlet form, "The Peculiar
Doctrines of the Gospel Explained and Defended,"
an apology for Calvinism, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
drew out an answer by "An Old-fashioned
Churchman." With more direct reference
to his special pursuits, he published "Mistakes
and Corrections in the Common Version
of the Scriptures, in the Hebrew Lexicon
of Gesenius, and in Richardson's Dictionary."</p>

<p>The most considerable venture which
Webster made in this field was in his edition
of the Bible. He was a Revision Committee
of one, and went to work with his
customary self-confidence not to retranslate
the Bible, but to correct and improve its
English, "with amendments of the language,"
the title-page declares. His reasons
for undertaking the work and his
principles of revision are given in the preface
to his edition, which was published at
New Haven in 1833:&mdash;</p>

<p>... "In the present [King James] version,
the language is, in general, correct
and perspicuous; the genuine popular English
of Saxon origin; peculiarly adapted to
the subjects; and in many passages uniting
sublimity with beautiful simplicity. In
my view, the general style of the version
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ought not to be altered. But in the lapse
of two or three centuries changes have taken
place, which in particular passages impair
the beauty, in others obscure the sense, of
the original languages. Some words have
fallen into disuse; and the signification of
others, in current popular use, is not the
same now as it was when they were introduced
into the version. The effect of
these changes is that some words are not
understood by common readers, who have
no access to commentaries, and who will
always compose a great proportion of readers;
while other words, being now used in
a sense different from that which they had
when the translation was made, present a
wrong signification or false ideas. Whenever
words are understood in a sense different
from that which they had when introduced,
and different from that of the
original languages, they do not present to
the reader the Word of God. This circumstance
is very important, even in things not
the most essential; and in essential points
mistakes may be very injurious. In my
own view of this subject, a version of the
Scriptures for popular use should consist of
words expressing the sense which is most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
common in popular usage, so that the first
ideas suggested to the reader should be the
true meaning of such words according to
the original languages. That many words
in the present version fail to do this is certain.
My principal aim is to remedy this
evil....</p>

<p>"In performing this task I have been
careful to avoid unnecessary innovations,
and to retain the general character of the
style. The principal alterations are comprised
in three classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. The substitution of words and phrases
now in good use for such as are wholly obsolete,
or deemed below the dignity and
solemnity of the subject.</p>

<p>"2. The correction of errors in grammar.</p>

<p>"3. The insertion of euphemisms, words
and phrases which are not very offensive to
delicacy, in the place of such as cannot, with
propriety, be uttered before a promiscuous
audience."</p>

<p>All this has a most familiar sound to-day,
and when Webster goes on with a plea
for consideration and a doubt as to how his
necessary work will be received, we seem
to hear again the apologies and defenses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with which the press has of late been filled.
People have used the Bible so long, Webster
observes, that they have acquired a
predilection for its quaintnesses. "It may
require," he continues, "some effort to subdue
this predilection; but it may be done,
and for the sake of the rising generation it
is desirable.... As there are diversities
of tastes among men, it is not to be expected
that the alterations I have made in the language
of the version will please all classes
of readers. Some persons will think I have
done too little; others, too much. And
probably the result would be the same,
were a revision to be executed by any other
hand, or even by the joint labors of many
hands. All I can say is that I have executed
this work in the manner which, in my
judgment, appeared to be the best.... In
this undertaking I subject myself to the
charge of arrogance; but I am not conscious
of being actuated by any improper motive.
I am aware of the sensitiveness of the religious
public on this subject, and of the difficulties
which attend the performance. But
all men whom I have consulted, if they have
thought much on the subject, seem to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
agreed in the opinion that it is high time
to have a revision of the common version of
the Scriptures; although no person appears
to know how or by whom such a revision is
to be executed. In my own view, such revision
is not merely a matter of expedience,
but of moral duty; and as I have been encouraged
to undertake this work by respectable
literary and religious characters, I have
ventured to attempt a revision upon my own
responsibility. If the work should fail to
be well received, the loss will be my own,
and I hope no injury will be done. I have
been painfully solicitous that no error should
escape me."</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand Webster's
attitude. He is a school-master in this business,
squaring Elizabethan English to suit
the regularity and uniformity of language
which have been the dream of all school-masters.
Rules without exceptions represent
the unattainable ideal of mechanical
minds. Webster, vainly endeavoring to reduce
language to an orderly system, was
also moved to secure propriety and decorum.
He seems, therefore, to have gone through
the book with his pen, transposing words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
into a more formal order, removing quaintnesses,
changing old forms into current ones,
putting on fig leaves, and, so far as he dared,
shaving the language to fit the measure of
the speech of his day. But he did not undertake
the work as a scholar, aiming at a
more exact version, and his emendations,
where the sense would be at all affected,
were very inconsiderable. He changed, to
be sure, <i>take no thought</i> into <i>be not anxious</i>,
as the Revisers have done, and he incorporated
into the text the marginal reading
<i>to them</i> for <i>by them</i> in the passage, <i>Ye have
heard that it hath been said by them of old
times.</i> He substituted <i>demons</i> for <i>devils</i>,
as the American Committee preferred; he
tried to put <i>hell</i> in its proper place, and in
some trivial instances he was more exact in
his use of prepositions, but one would look
in vain for any sign of Hebrew or Greek
scholarship beyond the most rudimentary.</p>

<p>Nor in respect of English did he seem to
have any conception of style or color; he
patched clauses with words of his time,
when he desired to remove an obsolete expression,
without any sense, apparently, of
incongruousness, and he removed words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
which were still perfectly clear in meaning,
only because they would not in his day so
be used. He was very much disturbed by
what he regarded as inelegance, and picturesque
phrases or words were likely to give
way to more commonplace ones. He did
not like <i>gather together</i> and substituted the
more rotund <i>assemble</i>, <i>collect</i>, or <i>convene</i>;
<i>three score</i> he wrote <i>sixty</i>; he hustled out
the strong phrase <i>gave up the ghost</i>, and
put in its place the "elegant" <i>expire</i>;
<i>peradventure</i> yielded to <i>perhaps</i> or <i>it may
be; laugh to scorn</i> he wrote <i>deride</i>. A good
example of his indifference to racy English
is in his substituting <i>in health</i> for <i>safe and
sound</i> in the clause, <i>because he hath received
him safe and sound</i>. "This is another
instance," he writes in his Introduction,
"in which the translators have followed
popular use instead of the original Greek,
which signifies simply <i>well</i> or <i>in health</i>."</p>

<p>Some of his alterations were in the direction
of greater intelligibility. He used <i>button</i>
instead of <i>tache</i>, <i>capital</i> for <i>chapiter</i>,
and made Hebrew proper names in the
New Testament conform to the usage of the
Old. "This will prevent illiterate persons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
who compose a large part of the readers of
the Scriptures, from mistaking the characters.
Every obstacle to a right understanding
of the Scriptures, however small, should
be removed, when it can be done in consistency
with truth." Like the American
Committee he preferred <i>Holy Spirit to Holy
Ghost</i>, and was willing to drop the title
<i>Saint</i> from the names of the evangelists, and
having all the authority necessary he made
these changes. In other instances there appears
an interesting agreement between
this independent American reviser of 1833
and the American Committee of the present
year; number VII. of the classes of
passages recorded at the close of the Revised
version, as preferred by the American
Committee, reads: "Substitute modern
forms of speech for the following archaisms,
namely, <i>who</i> or <i>that</i> for <i>which</i> when used of
persons; <i>are</i> for <i>be</i> in the present indicative;
<i>know</i>, <i>knew</i>, for <i>wot</i>, <i>wist</i>; <i>drag</i> or
<i>drag away</i> for <i>hale</i>," and Webster's corrections
upon the same plan are uniform. It
is unquestionably due to Webster that the
American Committee had this preference,
not to the Webster who revised the Bible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
for it is scarcely likely that his revision
was used for reference, but to the Webster
who early proposed such changes in the use
of language and never ceased to urge them
upon every occasion. So, too, both agree
in dropping <i>thy way</i> from the phrase <i>go
thy way</i>; in saying <i>urgent</i> for <i>instant</i>. The
variations, however, of the American Committee
from the English have reference
largely to readings.</p>

<p>The great bulk of Webster's emendations
were of the most trivial and innocent character.
<i>Whosoever</i> and <i>whatsoever</i> he always
cut down by the omission of the second
syllable; <i>unto</i> and <i>until</i> he changed to <i>to</i>
and <i>till</i>; <i>wherein</i> and its fellows he usually
rendered by <i>in which</i>, <i>on which</i>, <i>in that</i> or
<i>this</i>; <i>ate</i> he preferred to <i>did eat</i>, and <i>yes</i>
to <i>yea</i>. It was in general a picayune revision,
sufficient to annoy those who had an
ear for the old version, and really offering
only such positive helps in interpretation
as were generally in the possession of fairly
educated men. That he should have done
the work at all and have done it so faintly
is what surprises the reader. As a commercial
undertaking it was no mean matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and it was followed by the publication of an
edition of the New Testament alone. What
a strange miscalculation of forces it appears
to have been! It implied that readers generally
were as much martinets in language
as the editor, and it did not take into account
the immense inertia to be overcome,
when a single man should undertake to set
aside the accumulated reverence of two centuries.
The revision of the Bible by Webster
was in singular confirmation of traits of
character which have already been noted.
He had unlimited confidence in himself, an
almost childish ignorance of obstacles, a persistence
which was unembarrassed by the indifference
of others, and, from his long continued
occupation, a habit of magnifying the
trivial. He had not, in such a work as this,
the qualifications of a scholar; he had simply
the training of a school-master; he was
ignorant of what he was undertaking, and
his independent revision of the Bible failed
to win attention, not because it was audacious,
but because it was not bold enough; it
offered no real contribution to Biblical criticism.</p>

<p>He secured for it, indeed, a certain en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>dorsement.
A testimonial, signed by the
president and the most distinguished members
of the faculty of Yale College, recites
cautiously: "Dr. Webster's edition of the
Bible, in which the language of the translation
is purified from obsolete, ungrammatical,
and exceptional words and phrases, is
approved and used by many clergymen and
other gentlemen very competent to judge
of its merits," an ingenious form of words
which, I hope, satisfied Dr. Webster. Others,
chiefly his neighbors in New Haven,
signed more elaborate documents, intended,
apparently, to meet objections and prejudices
against a changed Bible. Webster himself
declared to the editors of a religious
paper, whom he suspected to be unfriendly
to his design, "I consider this emendation
of the common version as the most important
enterprise of my life, and as important
as any benevolent design now on foot; and
I feel much hurt that my friends should discountenance
the design." This was written
a few months after the publication of the
work. Eight years later, when he was in the
eighty-fourth year of his age, he still clung
to the hope that his work might be accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and put to general use; he had already in
his will bequeathed to each of his grandchildren
a copy of the book "handsomely
bound," the only one of his publications
thus marked by his favor, and the letter
which at this time, a year before his death,
he addressed to the Members of the Eastern
Association, in New Haven County, shows
no abatement in his faith.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">New Haven</span>, <i>May 19, 1842</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>: My edition of the Bible,
with emendations of the language of the
common version, has been before the public
about eight years. I have heard no objection
to the manner in which the work has
been executed, and, as far as my information
extends, the work is generally approved by
those who have examined it, among whom
are many clergymen, whose special duty it
is to guard the sacred text from corruption.
The body of the language in the common
version was introduced by Tyndale more
than three hundred and twenty years ago.
In the great length of time that has since
elapsed, the language has suffered many
material changes, some of which affect the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
sense of passages, rendering it obscure or
unintelligible to the unlettered part of readers.
Some passages are perverted by the
use of wrong words, the grammatical errors
are numerous, and many passages are expressed
in language which decency forbids
to be repeated in families and the pulpit.
For these reasons it appears to me that a
due regard to the interest of religion requires
a revision of the common version.
Indeed, all men seem to agree that amendments
are wanted, but who shall undertake
the work? So numerous are the denominations
of Christians that no one would undertake
it without the concurrence of others,
unless for sectarian purposes, and there is
no probability that a concurrence of all
could be obtained. For these reasons it
seems to be obvious, that if any improvement
is to be made in the version, the work
must be done by an individual. It is my
desire that the association shall take into
consideration the propriety of rendering me
their active aid in prompting the use of the
amended copy of the Bible in families and
schools. I am, gentlemen, with much respect,
your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">N. Webster.</span>"</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>His judgment has been partially confirmed,
partially set aside. One denomination
did undertake a revision and failed;
but contrary to Webster's belief it has been
found possible to obtain the concurrence of
different bodies of men for a revision which
comes with weight, and receives an attention
not to be secured by testimonials of
county associations. There was a wide difference
between Webster's conception of a
revision and that entertained by the distinguished
scholars who carried forward the
recent one. I wonder if one of those scholars
who signed the non-committal endorsement
of Webster's Bible may not, in the
midst of his recent labors, have contrasted
in his mind the learned company to which
he belonged with the school-master who offered
a Bible "purified from the numerous
errors."</p>

<h3>PREPARATION FOR THE DICTIONARY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not an uncommon experience by
which a young man strikes at once the note
of his career, then appears to wander or
experiment, and returns more surely to his
original expression, following that steadily
to the end. It was thus with Webster.
His "Grammatical Institute," inclosing the
perennial speller, was his first declaration;
then he made ventures in different directions,
but returned to studies in language,
and finally embodied the results of his life-time
in his great Dictionary. In reading
biography, we wish to get at the ruling
passion of the man; how often the man
himself seems bewildered in his search for
it, groping in this direction and in that,
uncertain, to use Dr. Bushnell's vigorous
phrase, if he has yet grasped the handle
of his being. It cannot be said that Webster
ever laid aside his special studies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
resumed them after long intervals. His
earliest and most characteristic work, "A
Grammatical Institute," was always by him,
and the Speller, which emerged from it, became
of so much pecuniary importance that
it could not fail to determine in many ways
his occupation. The "Minerva" from the
first had constant advertisements both of
"A Grammatical Institute" and of the early
volume of "Dissertations"; there were frequent
announcements of new editions of
the Spelling-Book, and of the rate at which
it could be had in quantities. Country
merchants began to lay in supplies of Webster's
Spelling-Book, when they came to the
nearest trading town, as confidently as they
bought West India goods or English tools.
Webster gave lectures, as he traveled north
and south, upon the English language. His
reputation was forming upon this line, and
it is not unlikely that his partial failure
in political and journalistic work was due
to his identification with the occupation of
a school-master. A more complete account
would be that he did not do these things
thoroughly well, because his strongest attraction
was in another direction. He seems,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
through the twenty years or more which followed
the first publication of his Spelling-Book,
to have his hand close by the throttle-lever
without knowing it. The practical
demands of self-support no doubt controlled
his inclinations, and forced him into one situation
after another where his choice would
not send him, and he spent these years in
a struggle for maintenance. Then he was
an impulsive, a generous, and an ambitious
man. He loved society; he liked the stir
of men and the bustle of management. As
we have already seen, he was ready to venture
all he had upon the stakes which his
ardor set up. He took risks in publishing,
which could be justified only by his own
enthusiasm, and entertained himself with
speculations in literature which were agreeable
to contemplate, but often disastrous to
realize. There is a half-despairing letter to
Josiah Quincy<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which discloses the hard
lines of his practical life. Trumbull had
jested at Webster's slight capital for house-keeping,
and Webster himself reached points
in his career where even Institutes and Dissertations
seemed to fail him. The letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
is dated at New Haven, February 12, 1811.
He writes with some irritation, "My name
has been so much bandied about that I am
quite willing it should be seen and heard no
more at present," and then passes to the
more important matters in his mind: "I
am engaged in a work which gives me
great pleasure, and the tracing of language
through more than twenty different dialects
has opened a new and before unexplored
field. I have within two years past made
discoveries which, if ever published, must
interest the literati of all Europe, and render
it necessary to revise all the lexicons&mdash;Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin&mdash;now used as
classical books. But what can I do? My
own resources are almost exhausted, and
in a few days I shall sell my house to get
bread for my children. All the assurances
of aid which I had received in Boston, New
York, etc., have failed, and I am soon to retire
to a humble cottage in the country. To
add to my perplexity, the political measures
pursuing render it almost impossible to sell
property, or to obtain money upon the best
security. A few thousand dollars, for which
I can give security, would place me in a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>dition
in the country to live with comfort
and pursue my studies; but even this cannot
be obtained till the measures of Congress
assume a more auspicious aspect.
Adieu, dear sir. The little Band will no
doubt do their duty, but what can be done
against the army of slaves? Alexander
Wolcott!! We must drink the cup of disgrace
to the dregs! Yours, in low spirits,</p>

<p class="right smcap">"N. Webster, Jun."</p>

<p>If the letter was an indirect appeal to
Mr. Quincy to advance a few thousand dollars
on good security, it does not seem to
have effected its purpose, and a man with
money to lend would not have his confidence
in the borrower's capacity to repay it
increased by knowing that the time of the
loan was to be occupied in making astonishing
discoveries in the roots of language. It
has often been stated that Dr. Webster supported
himself and large family, during the
twenty or thirty years he was employed in
the preparation of his great Dictionary,
mainly by a copyright of one cent or less
on his Spelling-Book, and it is quite certain
that the several other enterprises in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
he engaged never supported him while they
were going on, and often resulted in losses.
But what a picture the letter presents of an
impecunious scholar, bewitched by his pursuit,
and sure that it was to end in some
vast result! He writes like an inventor who
needs but little to enable him to perfect a
machine which is to revolutionize labor.</p>

<p>It was only a few years after the first
publication of the Spelling-Book, and while
Webster was still unmarried and trying his
hand at various occupations, that he published
"A Collection of Essays and Fugitiv
Writings on Moral, Historical, Political, and
Literary Subjects." The short-tailed word
on the title-page is an oddity intended probably
to attract the reader's attention and
lead him to look within. The contents
embrace thirty essays, originally written
or published between the years 1787 and
1790, but before the reader comes upon the
table of contents he is likely to stop at the
Preface with its antics of spelling. We are
tolerably used by this time to reformed
spelling, but Webster was a pioneer, and
his contemporaries must have looked with
some amazement at what they could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
think of as deformed spelling. Here they
could be told soberly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During the course of ten or twelv yeers
I hav been laboring to correct popular errors,
and to assist my yung brethren in the
road to truth and virtue; my publications
for theez purposes hav been numerous;
much time haz been spent, which I do not
regret, and much censure incurred, which
my hart tells me I do not dezerv. The influence
of a yung writer cannot be so powerful
or extensiv az that of an established
karacter; but I hav ever thot a man's usefulness
depends more on exertion than on
talents. I am attached to America by
berth, education, and habit; but abuv all,
by a philosophical view of her situation,
and the superior advantages she enjoys,
for augmenting the sum of social happiness....</p>

<p>"The reeder will obzerv that the orthography
of the volum iz not uniform. The
reezon iz, that many of the essays hav been
published before, in the common orthography,
and it would hav been a laborious
task to copy the whole, for the sake of
changing the spelling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the essays ritten within the last yeer,
a considerable change of spelling iz introduced
by way of experiment. This liberty
waz taken by the writers before the
age of Queen Elizabeth, and to this we are
indeted for the preference of modern spelling
over that of Gower and Chaucer. The
man who admits that the change of <i>housbonde</i>,
<i>mynde</i>, <i>ygone</i>, <i>moneth</i> into husband,
mind, gone, month, iz an improovment,
must acknowledge also the riting of helth,
breth, rong, tung, munth, to be an improovment.
There iz no alternativ. Every possible
reezon that could ever be offered for
altering the spelling of wurds, stil exists in
full force; and if a gradual reform should
not be made in our language, it will proov
that we are less under the influence of
reezon than our ancestors."</p>

<p>This passage from the Preface, as well as
those papers in the volume which follow the
same style of orthography or rather cacography,
will illustrate well enough the unprincipled
character of the reform as it lay
in Webster's mind. He acted upon the
merest empiricism apparently, without any
well-considered plan, making the spelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
occasionally conform to the sound, but allowing
even the same sounds to have different
representation in different words. Indeed,
in the extract given above, he appears
to be rather a timid reformer, attacking
such defenseless little words as <i>is</i>, and respectfully
passing by <i>would</i> and <i>offered</i>.
The general appearance of those essays in
the volume which are printed after Webster's
own heart leads one happening upon
them nowadays into some disappointment,
since they are by no means to be ranked
with the humorous writings of later mis-spellers,
who have contrived to get some
fun out of venerable words by pulling off
their wigs and false teeth and turning them
loose in the streets.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Webster's first impulse
to reform our spelling was given by
Dr. Franklin's writings on the subject. As
is well known, that philosopher went so far
as to devise new characters for compound
letters such as <i>th</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>ng</i>, anticipating many
of the later experiment in phonic writing.
Webster entered with zeal into the notion,
and held a correspondence with Franklin,
in which the young man showed himself so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
ardent a disciple of the old as to win for
himself a certain place as the doctor's residuary
legatee in ideas. "This indefatigable
gentleman," says Webster of Franklin,
"amidst all his other employments,
public and private, has compiled a Dictionary
on his scheme of a reform, and procured
types to be cast for printing it. He
thinks himself too old to pursue the plan;
but has honored me with the offer of the
manuscript and types, and expressed a
strong desire that I should undertake the
task. Whether this project, so deeply interesting
to this country, will ever be effected,
or whether it will be defeated by indolence
and prejudice, remains for my countrymen
to determine." The last clause,
with all its obscurity, may be taken as a
threat rather than as a self-reproach. The
entire correspondence between Webster and
Franklin is interesting as setting forth a certain
excess of experimenting ardor in Franklin
and an unlooked-for degree of conservatism
in Webster. Franklin was the older
man, but he was the more daring. One
should credit him, however, with a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>amount of humor in his whims. He played
with the English language, somewhat as
he amused himself with conferring legacies
at compound interest, to take effect in two
hundred years, and giving away gravely
millions of money by the immediate planting
of a few hundreds.</p>

<p>If the first impulse came from Franklin,
the controlling reason must be looked for
in Webster's patriotism. It was no trifling
desire to put into practice an engaging
theory, but a conviction of public gain
which moved Webster to proclaim his reform.
He has left abundant testimony to
this effect. After giving a brief historical
sketch of the changes to which the English
language had been subjected, in the
Appendix to his "Dissertations," he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The question now occurs: ought the
Americans to retain these faults which produce
innumerable inconveniences in the
acquisition and use of the language, or
ought they at once to reform these abuses,
and introduce order and regularity into the
orthography of the <span class="smcap">American Tongue</span>?"
He throws all the emphasis possible upon
these words by the use of large type, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
then sketches the nature of the proposed
reform, returning in the conclusion to his
favorite position of the influence upon national
speech and manners.</p>

<p>The whole statement is so interesting,
especially when taken into comparison with
the recent declarations of war by eminent
American philologists, that I transfer it to
these pages.</p>

<p>"Several attempts were formerly made in
England to rectify the orthography of the
language.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But I apprehend their schemes
failed of success rather on account of their
intrinsic difficulties than on account of any
necessary impracticability of a reform. It
was proposed, in most of these schemes, not
merely to throw out superfluous and silent
letters, but to introduce a number of new
characters. Any attempt on such a plan
must undoubtedly prove unsuccessful. It is
not to be expected that an orthography,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
perfectly regular and simple, such as would
be formed by a 'Synod of Grammarians on
principles of science,' will ever be substituted
for that confused mode of spelling
which is now established. But it is apprehended
that great improvements may be
made, and an orthography almost regular,
or such as shall obviate most of the present
difficulties which occur in learning our language,
may be introduced and established
with little trouble and opposition. The
principal alterations necessary to render our
orthography regular and easy are these:</p>

<p>"1. The omission of all superfluous or
silent letters; as <i>a</i> in <i>bread</i>. Thus <i>bread</i>,
<i>head</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>breast</i>, <i>built</i>, <i>meant</i>, <i>realm</i>,
<i>friend</i>, would be spelt <i>bred</i>, <i>hed</i>, <i>giv</i>, <i>brest</i>,
<i>bilt</i>, <i>ment</i>, <i>relm</i>, <i>frend</i>. Would this alteration
produce any inconvenience, any embarrassment
or expense? By no means. On
the other hand, it would lessen the trouble
of writing, and, much more, of learning the
language; it would reduce the true pronunciation
to a certainty; and while it
would assist foreigners and our own children
in acquiring the language, it would
render the pronunciation uniform in dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>ferent
parts of the country, and almost prevent
the possibility of changes.</p>

<p>"2. A substitution of a character that
has a certain definite sound for one that is
more vague and indeterminate. Thus by
putting <i>ee</i> instead of <i>ea</i> or <i>ie</i>, the words
<i>mean</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>speak</i>, <i>grieve</i>, <i>zeal</i>, would become
<i>meen</i>, <i>neer</i>, <i>speek</i>, <i>greev</i>, <i>zeel</i>. This
alteration could not occasion a moment's
trouble; at the same time it would prevent
a doubt respecting the pronunciation;
whereas the <i>ea</i> and <i>ie</i>, having different
sounds, may give a learner much difficulty.
Thus <i>greef</i> should be substituted for <i>grief</i>;
<i>kee</i> for <i>key</i>; <i>beleev</i> for <i>believe</i>; <i>laf</i> for <i>laugh</i>;
<i>dawter</i> for <i>daughter</i>; <i>plow</i> for <i>plough</i>; <i>tuf</i>
for <i>tough</i>; <i>proov</i> for <i>prove</i>; <i>blud</i> for <i>blood</i>;
and <i>draft</i> for <i>draught</i>. In this manner ch
in Greek derivatives should be changed
into <i>k</i>; for the English <i>ch</i> has a soft sound
as in <i>cherish</i>; but <i>k</i> always a hard sound.
Therefore <i>character</i>, <i>chorus</i>, <i>colic</i>, <i>architecture</i>,
should be written <i>karacter</i>, <i>korus</i>, <i>kolic</i>,
<i>arkitecture</i>, and were they thus written no
person could mistake their true pronunciation.
Thus <i>ch</i> in French derivatives should
be changed into <i>sh</i>; <i>machine</i>, <i>chaise</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span><i>chevalier</i>,
should be written <i>masheen</i>, <i>shaze</i>,
<i>shevaleer</i>, and <i>pique</i>, <i>tour</i>, <i>oblique</i>, should
be written <i>peek</i>, <i>toor</i>, <i>obleek</i>.</p>

<p>"3. A trifling alteration in a character,
or the addition of a point, would distinguish
different sounds without the substitution of
a new character. Thus a very small stroke
across <i>th</i> would distinguish its two sounds.
A point over a vowel in this manner, <i>&#551;</i> or <i>&#559;</i>
or <i>&#299;</i>, might answer all the purposes of different
letters. And for the diphthong <i>ow</i> let
the two letters be united by a small stroke,
or both engraven on the same piece of metal,
with the left hand line of the <i>w</i> united
to the <i>o</i>. These, with a few other inconsiderable
alterations, would answer every
purpose, and render the orthography sufficiently
correct and regular.</p>

<p>"The advantages to be derived from
these alterations are numerous, great, and
permanent.</p>

<p>"1. The simplicity of the orthography
would facilitate the learning of the language.
It is now the work of years for
children to learn to spell; and after all, the
business is rarely accomplished. A few
men, who are bred to some business that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
requires constant exercise in writing, finally
learn to spell most words without hesitation;
but most people remain all their lives
imperfect masters of spelling, and liable to
make mistakes whenever they take up a
pen to write a short note. Nay, many people,
even of education and fashion, never
attempt to write a letter without frequently
consulting a dictionary. But with the proposed
orthography, a child would learn to
spell, without trouble, in a very short time,
and the orthography being very regular, he
would ever after find it difficult to make
a mistake. It would, in that case, be as
difficult to spell <i>wrong</i> as it is now to spell
<i>right</i>. Besides this advantage, foreigners
would be able to acquire the pronunciation
of English, which is now so difficult and
embarrassing that they are either wholly
discouraged on the first attempt, or obliged,
after many years' labor, to rest contented
with an imperfect knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p>"2. A correct orthography would render
the pronunciation of the language as uniform
as the spelling in books. A general
uniformity thro the United States would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the event of such a reformation as I am here
recommending. All persons, of every rank,
would speak with some degree of precision
and uniformity. Such a uniformity in these
States is very desirable; it would remove
prejudice, and conciliate mutual affection
and respect.</p>

<p>"3. Such a reform would diminish the
number of letters about one sixteenth or
eighteenth. This would save a page in
eighteen; and a saving of an eighteenth
in the expense of books is an advantage
that should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>"4. But a capital advantage of this reform
in these States would be, that it would
make a difference between the English orthography
and the American. This will
startle those who have not attended to the
subject; but I am confident that such an
event is an object of vast political consequence.
For,</p>

<p>"The alteration, however small, would
encourage the publication of books in our
own country. It would render it, in some
measure, necessary that all books should be
printed in America. The English would
never copy our orthography for their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
use; and consequently the same impressions
of books would not answer for both
countries. The inhabitants of the present
generation would read the English impressions;
but posterity, being taught a different
spelling, would prefer the American orthography.</p>

<p>"Besides this, a <i>national language</i> is a
band of <i>national union</i>. Every engine
should be employed to render the people
of this country <i>national</i>; to call their attachments
home to their own country; and
to inspire them with the pride of national
character. However they may boast of independence,
and the freedom of their government,
yet their <i>opinions</i> are not sufficiently
independent; an astonishing respect
for the arts and literature of their parent
country, and a blind imitation of its manners,
are still prevalent among the Americans.
Thus an habitual respect for another
country, deserved indeed and once laudable,
turns their attention from their own interests,
and prevents their respecting themselves."</p>

<p>He supposes various objections to this reform:
that it would oblige people to relearn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the language; that it would render present
books useless; that it would injure the language
by obscuring etymology; that the
distinction between words of different meanings
and similar sound would be destroyed;
that it was idle to conform the orthography
of words to the pronunciation, because the
latter was continually changing. All these
objections he considers and meets with arguments
more familiar to us than they were to
men of his day, and then concludes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sensible I am how much easier it is
to <i>propose</i> improvements than to <i>introduce</i>
them. Everything new starts the idea of
difficulty, and yet it is often mere novelty
that excites the appearance; for on a slight
examination of the proposal the difficulty
vanishes. When we firmly believe a scheme
to be practicable, the work is half accomplished.
We are more frequently deterred
by fear from making an attack, than repulsed
in the encounter.</p>

<p>"Habit also is opposed to changes, for it
renders even our errors dear to us. Having
surmounted all difficulties in childhood,
we forget the labor, the fatigue, and the
perplexity we suffered in the attempt, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
imagine the progress of our studies to have
been smooth and easy. What seems intrinsically
right is so merely thro habit.
Indolence is another obstacle to improvements.
The most arduous task a reformer
has to execute is to make people <i>think</i>; to
rouse them from that lethargy, which, like
the mantle of sleep, covers them in repose
and contentment.</p>

<p>"But America is in a situation the most
favorable for great reformations; and the
present time is, in a singular degree, auspicious.
The minds of men in this country
have been awakened. New scenes have
been, for many years, presenting new occasions
for exertion; unexpected distresses
have called forth the powers of invention;
and the application of new expedients has
demanded every possible exercise of wisdom
and talents. Attention is roused, the
mind expanded, and the intellectual faculties
invigorated. Here men are prepared
to receive improvements, which would be
rejected by nations whose habits have not
been shaken by similar events.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> is the time, and <i>this</i> the country,
in which we may expect success in attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>ing
changes favorable to language, science,
and government. Delay in the plan here
proposed may be fatal; under a tranquil
general government the minds of men may
again sink into indolence; a national acquiescence
in error will follow, and posterity be
doomed to struggle with difficulties which
time and accident will perpetually multiply.</p>

<p>"Let us, then, seize the present moment
and establish a <i>national language</i> as well as
a national government. Let us remember
that there is a certain respect due to the
opinions of other nations. As an independent
people, our reputation abroad demands
that, in all things, we should be federal, be
<i>national</i>; for, if we do not respect ourselves,
we may be assured that other nations will
not respect us. In short, let it be impressed
upon the mind of every American, that to
neglect the means of commanding respect
abroad is treason against the character and
dignity of a brave, independent people."</p>

<p>In the matter of pronunciation, Webster
asserted similar principles in his earliest essays.
He denounces the custom of referring
to English standards for the determination
of sounds. In the "Remarks on the Man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>ners,
Government, and Debt of the United
States," which I quoted in the last chapter,
he finds fault with his countrymen for their
dependence upon England.</p>

<p>"This same veneration for eminent foreigners
and the bewitching charms of fashion
have led the Americans to adopt the
modern corruptions of our language. Very
seldom have men examined the structure of
the language to find reasons for their practice.
The pronunciation and use of words
have been subject to the same arbitrary or
accidental changes as the shape of their garments.
My lord wears a hat of a certain
size and shape; he pronounces a word in a
certain manner; and both must be right,
for he is a fashionable man. In Europe
this is right in dress; and men who have
not an opportunity of learning the just rules
of our language are in some degree excusable
for imitating those whom they consider
as superiors. But in men of science this
imitation can hardly be excused. Our language
was spoken in purity about eighty
years ago, since which time great numbers
of faults have crept into practice about the
theatre and court of London. An affected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
erroneous pronunciation has in many instances
taken place of the true, and new
words or modes of speech have succeeded
the ancient correct English phrases. Thus
we have, in the modern English pronunciation,
their natshures, conjunctshures, constitshutions,
and tshumultshuous legislatshures,
and a long catalogue of fashionable improprieties.
These are a direct violation of the
rules of analogy and harmony; they offend
the ear and embarrass the language. Time
was when these errors were unknown; they
were little known in America before the
Revolution. I presume we may safely say
that our language has suffered more injurious
changes in America, since the British
army landed on our shores, than it had suffered
before in the period of three centuries.
The bucks and bloods tell us that there is
no proper standard in language; that it is
all arbitrary. The assertion, however, seems
but to show their ignorance. There are, in
the language itself, decisive reasons for preferring
one pronunciation to another; and
men of science should be acquainted with
these reasons. But if there were none, and
everything rested on practice, we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
never change a general practice without
substantial reasons. No change should be
introduced which is not an obvious improvement."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, in a similar spirit, he writes:
"Nothing but the establishment of schools
and some uniformity in the use of books can
annihilate differences in speaking, and preserve
the purity of the American tongue.
A sameness of pronunciation is of considerable
consequence in a political view, for provincial
accents are disagreeable to strangers,
and sometimes have an unhappy effect upon
the social affections.... As an independent
nation our honor requires us to have a
system of our own, in language as well as
government. Great Britain, whose children
we are, and whose language we speak,
should no longer be our standard; for the
taste of her writers is already corrupted,
and her language on the decline. But if it
were not so, she is at too great a distance
to be our model, and to instruct us in the
principles of our own tongue.... Rapid
changes of language proceed from violent
causes, but these causes cannot be supposed
to exist in North America. It is contrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
to all rational calculation that the United
States will ever be conquered by any one
nation speaking a different language from
that of the country. Removed from the
danger of corruption by conquest, our language
can change only with the slow operation
of the causes before mentioned, and
the progress of arts and sciences, unless the
folly of imitating our parent country should
continue to govern us and lead us into endless
innovation. This folly, however, will
lose its influence gradually, as our particular
habits of respect for that country shall wear
away, and our <i>amor patri&aelig;</i> acquire strength,
and inspire us with a suitable respect for
our own national character. We have, therefore,
the fairest opportunity of establishing
a national language, and of giving it uniformity
and perspicuity in North America,
that ever presented itself to mankind."</p>

<p>His standard of pronunciation is thus defined:
"The rules of the language itself,
and the general practice of the nation, constitute
propriety in speaking. If we examine
the structure of any language we shall
find a certain principle of analogy running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>through the whole. We shall find in English
that similar combinations of letters have
usually the same pronunciation, and that
words having the same terminating syllable
generally have the accent at the same distance
from that termination. These principles
of analogy were not the result of design;
they must have been the effect of accident,
or that tendency which all men feel toward
uniformity. But the principles, when established,
are productive of great convenience,
and become an authority superior to
the arbitrary decisions of any man or class
of men. There is one exception only to
this remark: When a deviation from analogy
has become the universal practice of a
nation, it then takes place of all rules, and
becomes the standard of propriety. The
two points, therefore, which I conceive to
be the basis of a standard in speaking are
these: universal, undisputed practice, and
the principle of analogy. Universal practice
is generally, perhaps always, a rule of
propriety; and in disputed points, where
people differ in opinion and practice, analogy
should always decide the controversy.</p>

<p>"There are authorities to which all men
will submit; they are superior to the opin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>ions
and caprices of the great, and to the
negligence and ignorance of the multitude.
The authority of individuals is always liable
to be called in question; but the unanimous
consent of a nation, and a fixed principle interwoven
with the very construction of a
language, coeval and coextensive with it,
are like the common laws of a land, or the
immutable rules of morality, the propriety
of which every man, however refractory, is
forced to acknowledge, and to which most
men will readily submit."</p>

<p>Here is the doctrine of majorities, and
it will be seen that Webster's conception
of usage is not the usage of the most cultivated,
but the general usage of a people.
It was the democratic principle carried to
its utmost length, and yet the notion of an
inhering law was quite as strongly held.
Our interest in this portion of his work is
in the examples which he gives of the usage
of his day. He points out a number of instances
in which the different sections of
the Union were at variance, and some of
these characteristics have certainly disappeared.
Webster's memoranda may be
taken with some confidence, for he was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
minute observer, and his opportunities of
comparison were excellent.</p>

<p>In the Eastern States he finds a good
many people saying <i>motive</i>; in the Middle
States some who say <i>prejudice</i>. <i>E</i> before
<i>r</i> is often pronounced like <i>a</i>, as <i>marcy</i> for
<i>mercy</i>, an error which he refers rather illogically
to the practice of calling the letter
<i>r ar</i>, so that in his Spelling-Book he writes
its sound <i>er</i>; "in a few instances," he says,
"this pronunciation is become general
among polite speakers, as <i>clerk</i>, <i>sergeant</i>,
etc." In calling attention to the New England
custom of preferring the sound of <i>i</i>
short or <i>e</i> before the diphthong <i>ow</i>, as in
<i>kiow</i> for <i>cow</i>, Webster gravely refers the
disagreeable peculiarity "to the nature of
their government and a distribution of their
property." Let the reader reflect a moment
before he reads Webster's philosophical explanation,
and see if his own cogitations lead
him in the right direction. "It is an undoubted
fact that the drawling nasal manner
of speaking in New England arises almost
solely from these causes. People of large
fortunes, who pride themselves on family
distinctions, possess a certain boldness, dig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>nity,
and independence in their manners,
which give a corresponding air to their
mode of speaking. Those who are accustomed
to command slaves form a habit of
expressing themselves with the tone of authority
and decision. In New England,
where there are few slaves and servants,
and less family distinctions than in any
other part of America, the people are accustomed
to address each other with that
diffidence, or attention to the opinion of
others, which marks a state of equality. Instead
of commanding, they advise; instead
of saying, with an air of decision, <i>you must</i>;
they ask, with an air of doubtfulness, <i>is it
not best</i>? or give their opinions with an indecisive
tone; <i>You had better, I believe.</i>
Not possessing that pride and consciousness
of superiority which attend birth and fortune,
their intercourse with each other is
all conducted on the idea of equality, which
gives a singular tone to their language and
complexion to their manners.... Such are
the causes of the local peculiarities in pronunciation
which prevail among the country
people in New England, and which, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>foreigners, are the objects of ridicule. The
great error in their manner of speaking
proceeds immediately from not opening the
mouth sufficiently. Hence words are drawled
out in a careless lazy manner, or the sound
finds a passage thro the nose."</p>

<p>This may have the merit of ingenuity,
but in connection with it Webster makes a
sounder observation when he compares New
England perpetuating old English idioms
because of her isolation, to an internal village
contrasted with a city. "New England
has been in the situation of an island;
during one hundred and sixty years, the
people, except in a few commercial towns,
have not been exposed to any of the causes
which effect great changes in language and
manners."</p>

<p>To continue these notes: he finds the use
of <i>w</i> for <i>v</i> prevalent in Boston and Philadelphia,
as <i>weal</i> for <i>veal</i>, but unknown in
Hartford. "Vast numbers of people in
Boston and the neighborhood use <i>w</i> for <i>v</i>;
yet I never once heard this pronunciation
in Connecticut." He regards this use as
the survival of old custom, but since the
nation in general had made a distinction,
every person should resign his peculiarities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
for the sake of uniformity. "The words
<i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, <i>deceit</i>, <i>conceit</i>, <i>receipt</i>, are
generally pronounced by the Eastern people
<i>ither</i>, <i>nither</i>, <i>desate</i>, <i>consate</i>, <i>resate</i>. These
are errors; all the standard authors agree
to give <i>ei</i> in these words the sound of <i>ee</i>.
This is the practice in England, in the
Middle and Southern States, and, what
is higher authority, analogy warrants the
practice." He hesitates between <i>oblige</i>
and <i>obleege</i>, the weight of authority being
equally divided, but analogy persuades him
to the former. Analogy also requires Eur&oacute;pean,
though modern fashionable speakers
have been introducing the innovation of
Europ&eacute;an. "In the Middle and Southern
States <i>fierce</i>, <i>pierce</i>, <i>tierce</i>, are pronounced
<i>feerce</i>, <i>peerce</i>, <i>teerce</i>. To convince the people
of the impropriety of this pronunciation,
it might be sufficient to inform them
that it is not fashionable on the English
theatre.... The standard English pronunciation
now is <i>ferce</i>, <i>perce</i>, <i>terce</i>, and it is
universal in New England." He arraigns
the fashionable world for pronouncing <i>heard</i>
as herd, instead of by its true sound of
<i>heard</i>, in analogy with <i>feared</i>. "<i>Beard</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
is sometimes, but erroneously, pronounced
<i>beerd</i>. General practice, both in England
and America, requires that <i>e</i> should be pronounced
as in <i>were</i>, and I know of no rule
opposed to the practice." He objects to
the innovation of <i>woond</i> for <i>wound</i>, and
enters upon a long discussion of the pronunciation
of <i>nature</i>, finally falling back
upon his countrymen's <i>natur</i>.</p>

<p>Webster inculcated his views on orthography
and pronunciation upon all occasions.
He wrote, he lectured, he pressed home his
doctrines upon persons and assemblies. He
was one of the first to perceive the importance
of getting his principles adopted in
printing-houses. Long after the time of
which I am writing he continued to act as
a missionary in philology. The present
printer of "Webster's Dictionary" remembers
that when he was a boy of thirteen,
working at the case in Burlington, Vermont,
a little pale-faced man came into the
office and handed him a printed slip, saying,
"My lad, when you use these words, please
oblige me by spelling them as here: <i>theater</i>,
<i>center</i>," etc. It was Noah Webster traveling
about among the printing-offices, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
persuading people to spell as he did: a better
illustration could not be found of the reformer's
sagacity, and his patient method of
effecting his purpose.</p>

<p>His contemporaries were obliged to take
sides when so aggressive a spirit was among
them. His doctrines were discussed in society
and in print. The &#934; &#914; &#922; Society at
Yale debated upon the adoption of Webster's
orthography, deciding in 1792 in favor
of it, and reversing their decision in 1794.
Webster, by the way, was not unmindful of
his college. In 1790, as an encouragement
to the study of the English language, he
made a foundation for an annual prize to be
given to the author of the composition which
should be judged best by the faculty; but
the foundation does not appear to have been
permanent. Just as later he went to the
printing-offices to secure a conformity to his
orthography, so in the earlier years he had
directed his arguments at the schools. In
1798 he published "A Letter to the Governors,
Instructors, and Trustees of the Universities,
and other Seminaries of Learning
in the United States, on the Errors of English
Grammar," from which I have already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
quoted; and appeals to these men, who are
to give direction to the education of the
young, to free themselves from a slavish dependence
upon England. "It will be honorable
to us as a nation, and more useful to
our native tongue and to science, that we examine
the grounds of all rules and changes
before we adopt them, and reject all such
as have not obvious propriety for their foundation
or utility for their object."</p>

<p>Webster's studies had thus been gravitating
toward lexicography, and the habits of
mind which had been confirmed in his various
pursuits were precisely such as would
serve best the purpose which he was gradually
forming. Dr. Chauncey Goodrich, in
the memoir which is prefixed to the Dictionary,
remarks upon certain habits formed
by him early in life, which, becoming fixed
principles, were of inestimable advantage
in his labors afterward. While his memory
was tenacious, he was a great hoarder of
documents and marker of books; he was a
careful methodizer of his knowledge; he
accustomed himself to a great variety and
to unceasing diligence in literary toil, and
he was perpetually going back of facts to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the principles which he thought to underlie
them.</p>

<p>It had been his custom for many years to
jot down words which he met in reading,
and failed to find in dictionaries, and his labors
upon the Spelling-Book and Grammar
had familiarized him with the task of discriminating
and defining, and had also disclosed
to him the deficiencies in that respect
of current dictionaries. In 1806 he published
"A Compendious Dictionary of the
English Language," in which he announced,
with an amusing foretaste of the larger
claims of the "Unabridged," that it contained
five thousand more words than were
to be found in the best English compends.
The Dictionary was rendered still more useful
by taking under its protection various
tables of moneys and weights, an official list
of all the post-offices in the United States,
the number of inhabitants in the several
States, and new and instructive chronological
tables. This, by the way, was the first
occasion, I think, when a word-book had departed
from the customary boundaries of
such literature. I have been able to find
but one precedent, Dyche and Pardon's Dic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>tionary,
which, published a few years before,
had contained a supplementary list of
persons and places, arranged alphabetically,
and apparently only as a museum of curiosities.
This Dictionary had, however, as a
part of its regular text the several market
towns in England and Wales, with a general
description of the places, their situation,
market-days, government, manufacture,
number of representatives sent to parliament,
and distance from London. The
encyclop&aelig;dic features of a dictionary are
clearly of American addition, growing out
of the more general and exclusive use of the
Dictionary as a book of reference, and increased
by the suggestions of competition.
The Dictionary proper was an enlargement
of Entick, and in this preliminary work
Webster exercised very little authority in
deviating from the generally accepted orthography.
The extent of his changes is
indicated in his preface:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In a few instances I have preferred the
orthography of Newton, Prideaux, Hook,
Dryden, Whiston, etc., to that of Johnson,
as being more analogical and purely English,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>as <i>scepter</i>, <i>sepulcher</i>. In omitting <i>u</i>
in <i>honour</i> and a few words of that class I
have pursued a common practice in this
country, authorized by the principle of uniformity
and by etymology, as well as by
Ash's Dictionary. In omitting <i>k</i> after <i>c</i> [as
in <i>public</i>] I have unequivocal propriety and
the present usage for my authorities. In
a few words, modern writers are gradually
purifying the orthography from its corruptions.
Thus, Edwards in his 'History of
the West Indies,' and Gregory in his 'Economy
of Nature,' Pope, Hoole, etc., restore
<i>mold</i> to its true spelling; and it would be
no small convenience to revive the etymological
spelling of <i>aker</i>. Cullen, in his
translation of 'Clavigero,' follows Bacon
and Davenport in the true Saxon orthography
of <i>drouth</i>; and the elegant Blackstone
has corrected the orthography of <i>nusance</i>
and <i>duchy</i>. The diphthongs in words borrowed
from the Latin language have gradually
been sinking into desuetude for a century;
the few which remain I have expunged."</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson was the Magnus Apollo of
lexicographers then, and his bulky fame
still casts a large shadow over the world of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
words. To rebel against his autocratic rule
at the beginning of this century was to
write one's self down an audacious and presuming
sciolist. It is not surprising, therefore,
that Webster's criticism of Johnson in
this Dictionary and in other places should
have exposed him to censure. Dr. Ramsay
of Charleston, a man of consequence in his
day, wrote him that the "prejudices against
any American attempts to improve Dr.
Johnson were very strong in that city." The
letter gave Webster his opportunity, and he
at once wrote and published his vigorous
pamphlet respecting the "Errors in Johnson's
Dictionary and other Lexicons," which
is addressed to Dr. Ramsay. He takes a
very lofty view of the situation. "The intelligence,"
he writes, of this resentment in
Charleston, "is not wholly unexpected, for
similar prejudices have been manifested in
some parts of the Northern States. A man
who has read with slight attention the history
of nations, in their advances from barbarism
to civilization and science, cannot
be surprised at the strength of prejudices
long established and never disturbed. Few
centuries have elapsed since many men lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
their lives or their liberty by publishing
<span class="smcap">NEW TRUTHS</span>; and not two centuries have
past since Galileo was imprisoned by an
ecclesiastical court, for defending the truth
of the Copernican System, condemned to do
penance for three years, and his book burnt
at Rome, as containing dangerous and damnable
heresies. This example is cited as
one of a multitude which the history of man
presents to our view; and if it differs in <i>degree</i>,
it accords in <i>principle</i>, with the case
now before the American public."</p>

<p>He then, after admitting the value of
Johnson's ethical writings, but distrusting
his philological attainments, makes good his
objections by detailed specifications. He
condemns the insertion of a multitude of
words which do not belong to the language,
mentioning such unnaturalized foreigners
as <i>adversable</i>, <i>advesperate</i>, <i>adjugate</i>, <i>agriculation</i>,
<i>abstrude</i>, <i>injudicable</i>, <i>spicosity</i>, <i>crapulence</i>,
<i>morigerous</i>, <i>tenebrosity</i>, <i>balbucinate</i>,
<i>illachrymable</i>, etc., words to which the
reader may, if he knows Latin, attach some
sort of meaning, but which he would be
slow to introduce into his speech or writing.
Then he condemns Johnson's reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to writers of the seventeenth century who
buried their thoughts beneath cumbrous
piles of Latinized English, as in such passages
as:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The intire or broken <i>compagination</i> of
the magnetical fabric;" "The effects of
their activity are not precipitously <i>abrupted</i>,
but gradually proceed to their cessations;"
"Some have written rhetorically and <i>concessively</i>,
not controverting, but assuming,
the question, which, taken as granted, advantaged
the illation;" "Its fluctuations
are but motions subservient, which winds,
shelves, and every interjacency <i>irregulates</i>;"
passages given as illustrative of the
words italicized. "From a careful examination
of this work, and its effect upon the
language, I am inclined to believe that
Johnson's authority has multiplied instead
of reducing the number of corruptions in
the English language. Let any man of
correct taste cast his eye on such words as
<i>denominable</i>, <i>opiniatry</i>, <i>ariolation</i>, <i>assation</i>,
<i>ataraxy</i>, <i>clancular</i>, <i>comminuible</i>, <i>conclusible</i>,
<i>dedentition</i>, <i>deuteroscopy</i>, <i>digladiation</i>, <i>dignotion</i>,
<i>cubiculary</i>, <i>discubitory</i>, <i>exolution</i>,
<i>exeuterate</i>, <i>incompossible</i>, <i>incompossibility</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<i>indigitate</i>, etc., and let him say whether a
dictionary which gives thousands of such
terms as authorized English words is a safe
standard of writing.... In the 'English-Dutch
Dictionary' of Willcocke, we find the
compiler has translated <i>ariolation</i>, <i>clancular</i>,
<i>denomiable</i>, <i>comminuible</i>, etc., into Dutch.
In Bailey's 'Fahrenkruger,' we see <i>digladiation</i>,
<i>dignotion</i>, <i>exeuterate</i>, etc., turned into
German. These, or similar words, are by
Neuman translated into Spanish, and where
the mischief ends it is impossible to ascertain.
And what must foreigners think of
English taste and erudition, when they are
told that their dictionaries contain thousands
of such words which are not used by
the English nation!"</p>

<p>Webster's next point is that Johnson has
exceeded the bounds of legitimate lexicography
by the admission of vulgar and cant
words. "It may be alleged that it is the
duty of a lexicographer to insert and define
all words found in English books: then
such words as <i>fishify</i>, <i>jackalent</i>, <i>parma-city</i>,
<i>jiggumbob</i>, <i>conjobble</i>, <i>foutra</i>, etc., are legitimate
English words! Alas, had a native
of the United States introduced such vulgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
words and offensive ribaldry into a similar
work, what columns of abuse would have
issued from the Johnsonian presses against
the wretch who could thus sully his book
and corrupt the language!" He criticises
the accuracy with which Johnson has discriminated
the different senses of the same
word, and words nearly synonymous. The
illustrative quotations which bear so much
of the praise bestowed upon Johnson's Dictionary
he declares to be one of the most exceptionable
features, both because no small
number of the examples are taken from
authors who did not write the language
with purity, and because a still larger number
throw no light upon the definitions,
and are frequently entirely unnecessary.
He cites on this last point the passages
under the word <i>alley</i>, five in all, from
Spenser, Bacon, Milton, Dryden, and Pope.
"Does any reader of English want all these
authorities to show the word to be legitimate?
Far from it, nineteen twentieths of
all our words are so common that they require
no proof at all of legitimacy. Yet the
example here given is by no means the
most exceptionable for the number of au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>thorities
cited. The author sometimes offers
thirty or forty lines to illustrate words
which every man, woman, and child understands
as well as Johnson. Thirty-five lines
of exemplification under the word <i>froth</i>, for
example, are just as useless in explaining
the word as would be the same number of
lines from the language of the Six Nations."</p>

<p>His final charge rests on the inaccuracy
of the etymology. "As this has been generally
considered the least important part
of a dictionary the subject has been little
investigated, and is very imperfectly understood,
even by men of science. Johnson
scarcely entered the threshold of the subject.
He consulted chiefly Junius and
Skinner; the latter of whom was not possessed
of learning adequate to the investigation,
and Junius, like Vossius, Scaliger, and
most other etymologists on the Continent,
labored to deduce all languages from the
Greek. Hence these authors neglected the
principal sources of information, which were
to be found only in the north of Europe, and
in the west of Ireland and Scotland. In
another particular they all failed of success;
they never discovered some of the principal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
modes in which the primitive radical words
were combined to form the more modern
compounds. On this subject, therefore,
almost <i>everything remains to be done</i>....
I can assure the American public that the
errors in Johnson's Dictionary are ten times
as numerous as they suppose; and that the
confidence now reposed in its accuracy is
the greatest injury to philology that now
exists. I can assure them further that if any
man, whatever may be his abilities in other
respects, should attempt to compile a new
dictionary, or amend Johnson's, without a
profound knowledge of etymology, he will
unquestionably do as much harm as good."</p>

<p>A few years later Webster found an opportunity
to attack the general subject of
lexicography from another side, and one intimately
connected with his special work.
In 1816 Hon. John Pickering published
"A Vocabulary, or Collection of Words
and Phrases which have been supposed to
be peculiar to the United States of America.
To which is prefixed an Essay on the
Present State of the English Language in
the United States;" he had cited Webster
upon various words and plainly was aiming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
at him in his preface, when he declared that
"in this country, as in England, we have
thirsty reformers and presumptuous sciolists,
who would unsettle the whole of our
admirable language, for the purpose of making
it conform to their whimsical notions of
propriety." Webster at once addressed a
letter in print to Pickering, and took up
weapons, offensive and defensive, with alacrity
and confidence.</p>

<p>"This is a heavy accusation, Sir, from a
gentleman of your talents, liberality, and
candor," he writes. "Sciolists we may
have in multitudes; but who are the men
who would unsettle the whole of our language?
Can you name the men, or any of
them, either in this country or in England?
Surely the finger of scorn ought to be
pointed at the men who are base enough
to wish, and sottish enough to attempt, to
unsettle a whole language. I am confident,
Sir, that deliberate reflection will induce
you to retract a charge so injurious to your
fellow-citizens. It certainly becomes you,
and the character you maintain in society,
to learn the distinction between an attempt
to find what the language is, and an attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to unsettle its principles. Whether you
number me with the thirsty reformers and
presumptuous sciolists is a fact which I shall
take no pains to discover, nor, if known,
would the fact give me the smallest concern."
Webster's hand trembles evidently
with suppressed anger, but he grows firmer
as he goes on. "My studies have been
sometimes directed to philology, for the
exclusive purpose of ascertaining and unfolding
its principles, correcting abuses, and
supplying the defect of rules in our elementary
treatises. In the course of my researches
I have discovered a multitude of
errors and false principles, and numerous
defects in such treatises; and as I have
pushed my inquiries probably much farther
than any other man, I am satisfied that the
evidence I can lay before the public will
convince you that there is a rich mine of
knowledge to be opened on this subject
that your English friends have never yet
discovered." He takes up Pickering's Vocabulary
and rapidly criticises the several
entries; he renews his criticism upon Johnson
and Lowth, but the most interesting
part of the pamphlet is his stout advocacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of the claim of Americans to make and accept
changes of language which grow out
of their own conditions. The English language
was a common inheritance in England
and America, and in the necessary
growth of a spoken language, Americans
had equal right with Englishmen to contribute
to the growth; nay, that the American
was not a dialect of the English, but a
variation; not a departure from a standard
existing in contemporary England, but an
independent branch from a common stock.</p>

<p>"New words should not be introduced
into a copious language without reason, nor
contrary to its analogies. But a living language
must keep pace with improvements
in knowledge, and with the multiplication
of ideas. Those who would entirely restrain
the practice of using new words seem not
to consider that the limit they now prescribe
would have been as just and rational,
a thousand or two thousand years ago, as it
is at this period. If it should be said, we
have words enough to express all our ideas,
it may be truly answered, so had our ancestors
when they left the plains of Germany;
or when they first crossed the Hellespont;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
or when they left the soil of Persia. And
what then? Would the words they then
used be now sufficient for our purpose. And
who can define the bounds of future improvement?
Who will venture to allege
that men have not yet as much to learn as
they have already learnt? The smallest
acquaintance with the history of human
society and improvement ought to silence
the critics on this subject.</p>

<p>"Nor are we to believe that two nations
inhabiting countries separated by a wide
ocean can preserve a perfect uniformity of
language. If a perfect uniformity cannot
be produced or preserved in two distant
counties in England, how is this object to
be effected between the English in Great
Britain and their descendants in America,
India, or New Holland? Let history answer
the question. The art of printing,
interchange of books, and commercial intercourse
will retard the progress of mutation
and diversities; but no human means
can prevent some changes, and the adaptation
of language to diversities of condition
and improvement. The process of a living
language is like the motion of a broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
river, which flows with a slow, silent, irresistible
current." He turns the tables on
a writer who points out American barbarisms
by showing a number of English barbarisms
which had been creeping into use,
and declares that in the use of language
one nation as well as the other will commit
these errors, but he returns again and again
to his position that Americans in their use
of language are not to wait passively upon
English authority.</p>

<p>"I venerate," he says, "the men and
their writings; I venerate the literature,
the laws, the institutions, and the charities
of the land of my fathers. But I deprecate
the effects of a blind acquiescence in
the opinions of men, and the passive reception
of everything that comes from a
foreign press. My mind revolts at the reverence
for foreign authors, which stifles inquiry,
restrains investigation, benumbs the
vigor of the intellectual faculties, subdues
and debases the mind. I regret to see
the young Hercules of genius in America
chained to his cradle.... I left college with
the same veneration for English writers,
and the same confidence in their opinions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
which most of my countrymen now possess,
and I adopted their errors without examination.
After many years of research, I am
compelled to withdraw much of that confidence,
and to look with astonishment upon
the errors and false principles which they
have propagated; some of them of far more
consequence than any which have been mentioned
in the preceding remarks. I wish
to be on good terms with the English; it is
my interest and the interest of my fellow-citizens
to treat them as friends and brethren.
But I will be neither frowned nor
ridiculed into error, and a servile imitation
of practices which I know or believe to
be corrupt. I will examine subjects for myself,
and endeavor to find the truth, and to
defend it, whether it accords with English
opinions or not. If I must measure swords
with their travelers and their reviewers,
on the subject under consideration, I shall
not decline the combat. There is nothing
which, in my opinion, so debases the genius
and character of my countrymen as the
implicit confidence they place in English
authors, and their unhesitating submission
to their opinions, their derision, and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
frowns. But I trust the time will come
when the English will be convinced that
the intellectual faculties of their descendants
have not degenerated in America; and
that we can contend with them in <span class="smcap">LETTERS</span>
with as much success as upon the
<span class="smcap">OCEAN</span>.</p>

<p>"I am not ignorant, Sir, of the narrowness
of the sphere which I now occupy.
Secluded, in a great measure, from the
world, with small means, and no adventitious
aid from men of science; with little
patronage to extend my influence, and powerful
enmities to circumscribe it; what can
my efforts avail in attempting to counter-act
a current of opinion? Yet I am not
accustomed to despondence. I have contributed
in a small degree to the instruction
of at least four millions of the rising
generation; and it is not unreasonable to
expect that a few seeds of improvement,
planted by my hand, may germinate and
grow and ripen into valuable fruit, when
my remains shall be mingled with the
dust." A note is added, in which Webster
with grave banter offers a suit of clothes
to any English or American reviewer who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
will find a man capable of explaining the
little word <i>by</i>, stating its primary signification
and its true sense in its several uses
and applications.</p>

<p>The spirit with which Webster defended
himself was a manly one, and it is noticeable
how years of fencing had improved
the temper of his weapons. He was keener
in his thrusts, more dexterous and supple,
and comported himself in these disputes as
a man entirely confident of his position. It
is not vanity which upholds a man working
silently year after year at a task ridiculed
by his neighbors and denounced by
his enemies. Webster had something better
to sustain him than an idle self-conceit.
He had the reserve of a high purpose, and
an aim which had been growing more clearly
understood by himself, so that he could
afford to disregard the judgments of others.
There was in the outward circumstance of
his life something which testifies to the
sincerity and worth of his purpose. He had
withdrawn himself into the wilderness that
he might free himself from encumbrances
in his work, and with his love of society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
this was no light thing to do. His family
went with him reluctantly; but when did
not an enthusiast drag with him to his own
light sacrifice the unwilling attendants of
his life!</p>

<h3>AN AMERICAN DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of the Preface to his Compendious
Dictionary, Webster announced
his intention of compiling and publishing
a full and comprehensive dictionary of the
language. After answering the objections
which candid friends might raise, he added:
"From a different class of men, if such are
to be found, whose criticism would sink the
literature of this country even lower than
the distorted representations of foreign reviewers,&mdash;whose
veneration for transatlantic
authors leads them to hold American
writers in unmerited contempt,&mdash;from such
men I neither expect nor solicit favor. However
arduous the task, and however feeble
my powers of body and mind, a thorough
conviction of the necessity and importance
of the undertaking has overcome my fears
and objections, and determined me to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
an effort to dissipate the charm of veneration
for foreign authors which fascinates the
minds of men in this country and holds
them in the chains of illusion. In the investigation
of this subject great labor is to
be sustained, and numberless difficulties encountered;
but with a humble dependence
on Divine favor for the preservation of my
life and health, I shall prosecute the work
with diligence, and execute it with a fidelity
suited to its importance."</p>

<p>It was 1806 when he sat down to the
task, and twenty years of almost continuous
labor were expended before the work then
projected was given to the world in the
first edition of the "American Dictionary
of the English Language," in two volumes
quarto. Complete absorption in his work,
which could yield nothing until it was completed,
crippled his resources, confined now
in the main to copyright from his Spelling-Book;
and in 1812 he removed, as we
have already seen, for economy's sake, from
New Haven to Amherst. During the next
ten years he nearly completed the bulk of
the Dictionary, but there still remained
much to do in the way of comparison and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
finer study than his own library afforded.
He returned to New Haven in 1822, but
further work there showed the insufficiency
of material to be had in America; and in
1824, leaving his family, he took with him
a son and set out for Europe, for the purpose
of consulting men and books. He spent
two months in Paris, where S. G. Goodrich
met him. "A slender form, with a black
coat, black small-clothes, black silk stockings,
moving back and forth, with its hands
behind it, and evidently in a state of meditation.
It was a curious, quaint, Connecticut-looking
apparition, strangely in contrast
to the prevailing forms and aspects in this
gay metropolis. I said to myself, 'If it
were possible, I should say that was Noah
Webster!' I went up to him and found it
was indeed he."</p>

<p>He was satisfied that he should work to
better advantage in England. He went accordingly
to Cambridge in the early fall of
1824, and remained there until the following
May, using the resources of the University,
and making such connections as he
could, though he found rather barren sympathy
from English scholars, and small en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>couragement
from English publishers. His
training and studies, moreover, were not
such as to place him in very cordial relationship
with Englishmen, and his attitude
toward the scholastic deposit of an old nation
may be guessed from a passage in one
of his letters home, in which he writes:
"The colleges are mostly old stone buildings,
which look very heavy, cold, and
gloomy to an American accustomed to the
new public buildings in our country."</p>

<p>There is something in the whole undertaking,
and in the mode of its execution,
which makes one by turns wonder at the
splendid will and undaunted perseverance
of this Yankee teacher, and feel a well-bred
annoyance at his blindness to the incongruous
position which he occupied. One
is disposed to laugh sardonically over this
self-taught dictionary-maker, encamped at
Cambridge, coolly pursuing his work of an
American Dictionary of the English Language
in the midst of all that traditional
scholarship. But Webster's own consciousness
was of the gravity of his work. "When
I finished my copy," he writes in a letter
to Dr. Thomas Miner, "I was sitting at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
my table in Cambridge, England, January,
1825. When I arrived at the last word I
was seized with a tremor that made it difficult
to proceed. I, however, summoned up
strength to finish the work, and then, walking
about the room, I soon recovered." This
may be a faint echo of Gibbon's celebrated
passage, but it is inherently truthful, and
marks the effect upon him of a sustained
purpose, brought, after a score of years, to
completion. The Dictionary was published
three years after his return to America, and
passed through one revision at Mr. Webster's
hands in 1840. He was still at work
upon it when he died, in 1843. It is fair
to look to the preface of a great work, especially
of one which seems to admit little
personality, for an account of the motives
and aims of the workman. In following
the lines of Webster's preface we discover
the principles which we have already noted
stated anew and with increasing confidence.
He gives reasons why it had become necessary
that an English dictionary should be
revised to meet the exigencies of American
as distinct from English life, and he says
finally: "One consideration, however, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
is dictated by my own feelings, but which I
trust will meet with approbation in correspondent
feelings in my fellow-citizens, ought
not to be passed in silence; it is this: 'The
chief glory of a nation,' says Dr. Johnson,
'arises from its authors.' With this opinion
deeply impressed on my mind, I have
the same ambition which actuated that great
man when he expressed a wish to give celebrity
to Bacon, to Hooker, to Milton, and
to Boyle. I do not, indeed, expect to add
celebrity to the names of Franklin, Washington,
Adams, Jay, Madison, Marshall,
Ramsay, Dwight, Smith, Trumbull, Hamilton,
Belknap, Ames, Mason, Kent, Hare,
Silliman, Cleaveland, Walsh, Irving, and
many other Americans distinguished by
their writings or by their science; but it is
with pride and satisfaction that I can place
them, as authorities, on the same page with
those of Boyle, Hooker, Milton, Dryden,
Addison, Ray, Milner, Cowper, Thomson,
Davy, and Jameson. A life devoted to reading
and to an investigation of the origin and
principles of our vernacular language, and
especially a particular examination of the
best English writers, with a view to a com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>parison
of their style and phraseology with
those of the best American writers and with
our colloquial usage, enables me to affirm,
with confidence, that the genuine English
idiom is as well preserved by the unmixed
English of this country as it is by the best
<i>English</i> writers. Examples to prove this
fact will be found in the Introduction to this
work. It is true that many of our writers
have neglected to cultivate taste and the
embellishments of style, but even these have
written the language in its genuine <i>idiom</i>.
In this respect Franklin and Washington,
whose language is their hereditary mother-tongue,
unsophisticated by modern grammar,
present as pure models of genuine
English as Addison and Swift. But I may
go further, and affirm with truth that our
country has produced some of the best models
of composition. The style of President
Smith, of the authors of the Federalist, of
Mr. Ames, of Dr. Mason, of Mr. Harper, of
Chancellor Kent, [the prose]" happily bracketed
reservation! "of Mr. Barlow, of Dr.
Channing, of Washington Irving, of the
legal decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States, of the reports of legal decis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ions
in some of the particular States, and
many other writings, in purity, in elegance,
and in technical precision, is equalled only
by that of the best British authors, and surpassed
by that of no English compositions
of a similar kind.</p>

<p>"The United States commenced their existence
under circumstances wholly novel
and unexampled in the history of nations.
They commenced with civilization, with
learning, with science, with constitutions of
free government, and with that best gift of
God to man, the Christian religion. Their
population is now equal to that of England;
in arts and sciences our citizens are very
little behind the most enlightened people
on earth,&mdash;in some respects they have no
superiors; and our language within two
centuries will be spoken by more people in
this country than any language on earth,
except the Chinese, in Asia, and even that
may not be an exception."</p>

<p>It is instructive to compare the preface
with the celebrated one by Dr. Johnson,
introducing his dictionary. Webster, filled
with a parochial enthusiasm for his native
country, exaggerates the necessity for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
local dictionary, and anticipates the vast
audience that will one day require his work.
To him language is the instrument not so
much of literature as of daily association.
He thinks of a dictionary as a book of reference
for the plain reader, and a guide
to him in the correct use of his vernacular.
Johnson, proud of his literary heritage,
burdened with a sense of his own inadequacy,
at once confesses the dignity of
his work and the melancholy of his own
nature. He acknowledges the limitation of
his own philological attainments, and rests
his claims to honor upon the fullness with
which he has gathered and arranged the
materials scattered through the vast area of
English literature. The one sees the subject
from the side of nationality, the other
from that of literature. Webster is thinking
of his own people, Johnson of the un-national
tribe of scholars and men of letters.
The historical associations justify each, for
Johnson was distinctly the member of a
great class which was beginning to assert
its independence of social authority. With
all his loyalty to his king, he was at heart a
republican in literature, and stoutly denied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the divine right of patrons. His dictionary
was the sign of literary emancipation; it
was the witness to an intellectual freedom
which might be in alliance with government,
but could not be its tool. The history
of English literature since that date is
a democratic history. Webster, on his part,
was the prophet of a national independence,
in which language and literature were involved
as inseparable elements. To him
books were neither the production nor the
possession of a class, but necessarily incident
to the life of a free people. Hence, in
his citation of American authorities, he is
undaunted by the paucity of purely literary
men; law reports and state documents
answer his purpose as well. He saw literature
as the accompaniment of self-government,
and the dictionary in his eyes was a
vast school-book, not a thesaurus of literature.</p>

<p>I can hardly expect my readers to follow
me patiently through a close examination of
the successive editions of Webster's large
dictionary, and I have no such high opinion
of my own patience as to suppose that I
should continue on the road after my read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ers
had dropped behind; but it is possible
to make a rough comparison of the first edition
of 1828 and the latest of 1880, in order
to see what Webster did which needed
to be undone, and to form some estimate
of the substantial service which he rendered
lexicography in that edition which was more
nearly his sole and unaided work.</p>

<p>To take, then, the matter of orthography,
there are certain general classes of words
which have borne the brunt of criticism.
In his first edition Webster's rule was to
omit <i>k</i> after <i>c</i> from the end of all words of
more than one syllable, and to retain it in
longer forms of the same word only when it
was required to defend the hard sound of c.
He wrote thus: <i>public</i>, <i>publication</i>. But
Webster, like writers of to-day, was constantly
allowing his uniform rule to give
way in cases where custom had fastened
upon him. Thus he still spelled <i>traffick</i>,
<i>almanack</i>, <i>frolick</i>, <i>havock</i>, and it was quite
possible for his critics to follow him through
a long list of words of this class and detect
his frequent aberration from a uniform rule.
Yet, instead of receding from his position,
the latest edition advances; a nicer discrimi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>nation
is made in the etymological origin
of the variation, but in point of practice a
much more general conformity to the rule
is recorded. There can be no question that
the <i>k</i> has a foreign air when found in such
cases in American books.</p>

<p>Again, Webster omitted the <i>u</i> in the unaccented
termination <i>our</i>, as <i>honor</i> for <i>honour</i>.
In this, too, he was not without English
precedent. Johnson was singularly inconsistent
in this respect, and his influence
has extended over English orthography to
the present day, so that one cannot take up
a well-printed English journal without discovering
an apparently arbitrary use of the
termination. The usage as recorded by
Webster has held its ground, and there is
no variation between the first and latest
editions, except that the alternative form
<i>Saviour</i> is given in the latest as a concession
to an undefined sense of sanctity which
would lead to a separation of the word from
its class. There is a foot-note in the edition
of 1828, in which Washington's omission of
<i>u</i> is cited as an argument in favor of the
form <i>or</i>.</p>

<p>There is the vexed form <i>er</i> for <i>re</i> in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
words as <i>center</i> for <i>centre</i>. It is fair on this
point to give the note which Webster originally
made in defense of his position: "A
similar fate has attended the attempt to Anglicize
the orthography of another class of
words, which we have received from the
French. At a very early period the words
<i>chambre</i>, <i>desastre</i>, <i>desordre</i>, <i>chartre</i>, <i>monstre</i>,
<i>tendre</i>, <i>tigre</i>, <i>entre</i>, <i>fievre</i>, <i>diametre</i>, <i>arbitre</i>,
<i>nombre</i>, and others were reduced to the English
form of spelling: <i>chamber</i>, <i>disaster</i>,
<i>charter</i>, <i>monster</i>, <i>tender</i>, <i>tiger</i>, <i>enter</i>, <i>fever</i>,
<i>diameter</i>, <i>arbiter</i>, <i>number</i>. At a later period,
Sir Isaac Newton, Camden, Selden,
Milton, Whitaker, Prideaux, Hook, Whiston,
Bryant, and other authors of the first
character attempted to carry through this
reformation, writing <i>scepter</i>, <i>center</i>, <i>sepulcher</i>.
But this improvement was arrested,
and a few words of this class retain their
French orthography: such as <i>metre</i>, <i>mitre</i>,
<i>nitre</i>, <i>spectre</i>, <i>sceptre</i>, <i>theatre</i>, <i>sepulchre</i>, and
sometimes <i>centre</i>. It is remarkable that a
nation distinguished for erudition should
thus reject improvements, and retain anomalies,
in opposition to all the convenience of
uniformity. I am glad that so respectable a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
writer as Mitford has discarded this innovation,
and uniformly written <i>center</i>, <i>scepter</i>,
<i>theater</i>, <i>sepulcher</i>. In the present instance
want of uniformity is not the only
evil. The present orthography has introduced
an awkward mode of writing the derivatives,
for example, <i>centred</i>, <i>sceptred</i>,
<i>sepulchred</i>; whereas Milton and Pope wrote
these words as regular derivatives of <i>center</i>,
<i>scepter</i>, <i>sepulcher</i>, thus, '<i>Sceptered</i> king.'
So Coxe in his travels, 'The principal
wealth of the church is <i>centered</i> in the
monasteries.' This is correct."</p>

<p>The two Websters agree in the main, but
some of the variations in the first disappear
in the latest. Thus Noah Webster gave
the alternative forms <i>massacer</i>, <i>massacre</i>,
preferring the former, and <i>aker</i>, <i>acre</i>, a curious
inconsistency; the editors of the latest
edition have dropped these proposed improvements,
and have given secondary alternative
forms in <i>theatre</i>, <i>metre</i>, <i>centre</i>,
<i>sepulchre</i>, <i>nitre</i>, and perhaps some others.
Both accept <i>chancre</i>, <i>lucre</i>, and <i>ogre</i>. It
may be said in general that the game on
these words is a drawn one, with a stubborn
retention of the <i>re</i> form on the part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
most careful writers, and a growing majority
in numbers in favor of the <i>er</i> form.</p>

<p>In the edition of 1828 Webster laid down
the rule that verbs ending in a single consonant,
but having the accent on the first
syllable, or on a syllable preceding the last,
ought not to double the final consonant in
the derivatives. Thus he wrote <i>travel</i>,
<i>traveler</i>, <i>traveling</i>. The editors of the latest
edition find no occasion to revise this rule,
and report that other lexicographers advise
a conformity to it, but they record a large
number of exceptions to satisfy "the prejudice
of the eye." His corresponding rule
is "that monosyllabic verbs, ending in a
single consonant, not preceded by a long
vowel, and other verbs ending in a single
accented consonant, and of course not preceded
by a long vowel, double the final consonant
in all the derivatives which are
formed by a termination beginning with a
vowel." This applies to <i>fit</i>, <i>fitted</i>, <i>compel</i>,
<i>compelled</i>. This rule, like the other, is retained
by the later editors, though both rules
are more exactly framed. No question has
been raised upon this point, and the nice
correspondence of the two rules is likely in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
process of time to break down those exceptions
to the former which usage now makes
familiar.</p>

<p>Does the reader, when he writes, hesitate
perilously before the words <i>distil</i> or <i>distill</i>,
<i>control</i> or <i>controll</i>, <i>recal</i> or <i>recall</i>? It
can only be said that neither Webster nor
his editors could frame a rule which they
were ready to follow. They agree in their
inconsistencies, and have brought over other
lexicographers in some cases to their disposition
to double the <i>l</i>. The indecision,
however, which one feels before <i>skilful</i> or
<i>skillful</i> is more painful,&mdash;are we to say
<i>painfull</i>? Here again the first and latest
editions of Webster are at one with each
other, and at variance with old and established
usage. The editors of Webster appear
to yield the ground a little by conceding
that <i>skilful</i>, <i>dulness</i>, and like words are
so written by many. Webster's change in
this respect seems therefore to have made no
headway except in his own family.</p>

<p>There are other words which may be
grouped in classes, but I will content myself
with a further enumeration, somewhat
at random, of words which Webster trifled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
with, as his enemies might say, or reduced
to order, as he would claim; placing in
parallel columns the spelling adopted in
the first edition and that followed in the
latest:&mdash;</p>

<p>It should be added that in many cases
where the later editors have receded from
Webster's advanced position they have added
a note approving his innovation as etymologically
correct and preferable. There
can be no doubt that Webster was careless
and inconsistent in his entry of these words,
since he would venture his improvement
under the word, fling scorn at the current
usage, and then, when using the word else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>where
in definition or in compounds, forget
his improvement and follow the customary
orthography. From our rapid survey of the
orthography, however, it may be said in
general that Webster's decision in the case
of classes of words has been maintained
in subsequent editions, but his individual
alterations have been regarded as contributions
to an impossibly ideal correct orthography,
and quietly dropped. The fact
illustrates Webster's strength and weakness.
His notions on the subject of uniformity
were often very sensible, and he
had the advantage of reducing to order what
was hopelessly chaotic in common usage.
But his sense of the stability of usage was
imperfect, and when he moved among the
words at random, arranging the language
to suit his personal taste, he discovered or
his successors did that words have roots of
another kind than what etymologists regard.</p>

<p>Webster was wont to defend himself
against the common charge of proposing
new forms of words, by showing that, if
one went far enough back, he would be sure
to come upon the same forms in English lit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>erature;
that his aim was to restore, not to
invent, and to bring back the language to
its earlier and historic shape. This is a defense
familiar to us in these later days of
spelling reform; and no one doubts, who
knows the chaos of English spelling before
the days of printing, that authority could
be found for any favorite mode of spelling
a word. Webster claimed the same conservative
principles in the matter of pronunciation,
and stoutly declared that he was
a champion for historic English sounds as
opposed to the innovations offered by Sheridan,
Walker, and Jamieson. "The language
of a nation," he says in his Introduction,
"is the common property of the people,
and no individual has a right to make in-roads
upon its principles. As it is the medium
of communication between men, it is
important that the same written words and
the same oral sounds to express the same
ideas should be used by the whole nation.
When any man, therefore, attempts to
change the established orthography or pronunciation,
except to correct palpable errors
and produce uniformity by recalling wanderers
into the pale of regular analogies, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
offers an indignity to the nation. No local
practice, however respectable, will justify
the attempt. There is great dignity, as
well as propriety, in respecting the universal
and long-established usages of a nation.
With these views of the subject, I feel myself
bound to reject all modern innovations
which violate the established principles and
analogies of the language, and destroy or
impair the value of alphabetical writing. I
have therefore endeavored to present to my
fellow-citizens the English language in its
genuine purity, as we have received the inheritance
from our ancestors, without removing
a landmark. If the language is fatally
destined to be corrupted, I will not be an
instrument of the mischief."</p>

<p>These are certainly brave words, and there
are even people who would doubt if Webster
had the courage of such convictions. In his
Dictionary he seems to have somewhat underestimated
the importance of noting the
pronunciation. He devotes a number of
pages, it is true, in the Introduction, to a
discussion of the principles involved, but in
marking the words he used only the simplest
method, and disregarded refinements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
speech. The word culture, for instance, is
marked by him <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[c-]ul&acute;ture,</span> while in the latest edition it appears as <span style="white-space:nowrap;">[c-]&#365;lt&acute;&#363;re</span>
<span style="white-space:nowrap;">(k&#365;lt&acute;y&#7795;r)</span>. He
had a few antipathies, as to the <i>tsh</i> sound
then fashionable in such words as <i>tumult</i>, and
with a certain native pugnacity he attacked
the orthoepists who at that time had elaborated
their system more than had the orthographists;
he did not believe that nice shades
of sound could be represented to the eye by
characters, and he appears to have been
somewhat impatient of the whole subject.
He maintained that the speech which generally
prevailed in New England in his day
represented the best and most historic pronunciation.
The first ministers had been
educated at the universities, and the respect
felt for them had led to a general acceptance
of their mode of speech. He himself
said <i>vollum</i> for volume, and <i>p&#259;triot</i>, and
<i>perce</i> for pierce. He regarded Sheridan,
Walker, Perry, Jones, and Jamieson as having,
in their attempts at securing uniformity,
only unsettled the old and familiar speech,&mdash;a
curious commentary on his own performances
in orthography. He does not
here, either, forget his loyalty to America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
"In a few instances," he says, "the common
usage of a great and respectable portion of
the people of this country accords with the
analogies of the language, but not with the
modern notation of English orthoepists. In
such cases it seems expedient and proper to
retain our own usage. To renounce a practice
confessedly regular for one confessedly
anomalous, out of respect to foreign usage,
would hardly be consistent with the dignity
of lexicography. When we have principle
on our side, let us adhere to it. The time
cannot be distant when the population of
this vast country will throw off their leading-strings,
and walk in their own strength;
and the more we can raise the credit and
authority of principle over the caprices of
fashion and innovation, the nearer we approach
to uniformity and stability of practice."</p>

<p>The absence of the finer qualities of scholarship
in Webster's composition is indicated
by his somewhat rough and ready
treatment of the subject of pronunciation;
perhaps no more delicate test exists of the
grain of an educated person's culture than
that of pronunciation. It is far more subtle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
than orthography or grammar, and pleasure
in conversation, when analyzed, will show
this fine sense of sound and articulation to
be the last element.</p>

<p>If any one had asked Webster upon what
part of his Dictionary he had expended the
most time and now set the highest value, he
would undoubtedly have answered at once
the etymology, and whatever related to
the history and derivation of words. The
greater part of the time given continuously,
from 1807 to 1826, to the elaboration of his
Dictionary was spent upon this department;
his severest condemnation of Johnson was
upon the score of his ignorance in these particulars,
and the credit which he took to
himself was frank and sincere. There can
be no doubt that he worked hard; there can
be no doubt, either, that he had his way to
make almost unaided by previous explorers.
The science of comparative philology is of
later birth; the English of Webster's day
were no better equipped than he for the
task which he undertook, except so far as
they were trained by scholarship to avoid
an empirical method. Horne Tooke was
the man who opened Webster's eyes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
him he followed so long as he followed anybody.
But Tooke was a guesser, and Webster,
with all his deficiencies, had always a
strong reliance upon system and method.
He made guesses also, but he thought they
were scientific analyses, and he came to the
edge of real discoveries without knowing it.</p>

<p>The fundamental weakness of Webster's
work in etymology lay in his reliance upon
external likenesses and the limitation of his
knowledge to mere vocabularies. It was
not an idle pedantry which made him marshal
an imposing array of words from Oriental
languages; he was on the right track
when he sought for a common ground upon
which Indo-European languages could meet,
but he lacked that essential knowledge of
grammatical forms, without which a knowledge
of the vocabulary is liable to be misleading.
His comparison of languages may
be compared to the earlier labors of students
in comparative anatomy who mistook
merely external resemblances for structural
homology. It would be idle to institute
any inquiry into the agreement of the
1828 edition with the latest edition. All of
Webster's original work, as he regarded it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
has been swept away, and the etymology
reconstructed by Dr. Mahn, of Berlin, in
accordance with a science which did not
exist in Webster's day. The immense
labor which Webster expended remains
only as a witness to that indomitable spirit
which enabled him to keep steadfastly to
his self-imposed task through years of isolation.</p>

<p>The definitions in Webster's first edition
offer an almost endless opportunity for comment.
He found Johnson's definitions wanting
in exactness, and often rather explanations
than definitions. For his part he
aimed at a somewhat plainer work. He
was under no temptation, as Johnson was,
to use a fine style, but was rather disposed
to take another direction and use an excessive
plainness of speech, amplifying his
definition by a reference in detail to the
synonymous words. It must be said, however,
that Webster was often unnecessarily
rambling in his account of a word, as when,
for instance, under the word <i>magnanimity</i>
he writes: "Greatness of mind; that elevation
or dignity of soul which encounters
danger and trouble with tranquillity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
firmness, which raises the possessor above
revenge, and makes him delight in acts of
benevolence,&mdash;which makes him disdain injustice
and meanness, and prompts him to
sacrifice personal ease, interest, and safety
for the accomplishment of useful and noble
objects;" in the latest Webster the same
terms are used but with a judicious compression.
Johnson's account reads, "Greatness
of mind; bravery; elevation of soul." Webster
was disposed also to mingle rather more
encyclop&aelig;dic information with his definitions
than a severer judgment of the limits
of a dictionary now permits. Thus under
the word <i>bishop</i>, besides illustrative passages,
he gives at length the mode of election in
the English Church, and also that used in
the Episcopal Church in America. But this
fullness of description was often a positive
addition. Here again a comparison may be
made with Johnson. Under the word <i>telescope</i>,
Johnson simply says: "A long glass
by which distant objects are viewed." Webster:
"An optical instrument employed in
viewing distant objects, as the heavenly
bodies. It assists the eye chiefly in two
ways: first, by enlarging the visual angle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
under which a distant object is seen, and
thus magnifying that object; and secondly,
by collecting and conveying to the eye a
larger beam of light than would enter the
naked organ, and thus rendering objects distinct
and visible which would otherwise be
indistinct and invisible. Its essential parts
are the <i>object-glass</i>, which collects the beams
of light and forms an image of the object, and
the <i>eyeglass</i>, which is a microscope by which
the image is magnified." The latest editors
have found nothing to change in this definition
and nothing to add, except a long account
of the several kinds of telescopes. In
the introduction and the definition of words
employed in science Webster was for the
time in advance of Johnson, as the present
Webster is far in advance of the first from
the natural increase in the importance and
number of these terms. But Webster did
not merely use his advantages; he had a
keener sense than Johnson of the relative
weight of such words. Johnson harbored
them as unliterary, but Webster welcomed
them as a part of the growing vocabulary
of the people.</p>

<p>Webster claimed to have nearly doubled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the number of words given in Johnson,
even after he had excluded a number which
found their place in Johnson. He swelled
the list, it is true, by the use of compounds
under <i>un</i> and similar prefixes, but the noticeable
fact remains that he incorporated
in the Dictionary a vast number of words
which previously had led a private and
secluded life in special word-books. His
object being to make a dictionary for the
American people, his ambition was to produce
a book which should render all other
books of its class unnecessary. Webster
himself enumerates the words added in his
Dictionary under five heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Words of common use, among which
he notes: grand-jury, grand-juror, eulogist,
consignee, consignor, mammoth, maltreatment,
iceberg, parachute, malpractice, fracas,
entailment, perfectibility, glacier, fire-warden,
safety-valve, savings-bank, gaseous,
lithographic, peninsular, repealable, retaliatory,
dyspeptic, missionary, nervine, meteoric,
mineralogical, reimbursable; to quarantine,
revolutionize, retort, patent, explode,
electioneer, reorganize, magnetize.</p>

<p>2. Participles of verbs, previously omitted,
and often having an adjective value.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Terms of frequent occurrence in historical
works, especially those derived from
proper names, such as Shemitic, Augustan,
Gregorian.</p>

<p>4. Legal terms.</p>

<p>5. Terms in the arts and sciences. This
was then the largest storehouse, as it has
since been, and the reader may be reminded
that this great start in lexicography was coincident
with the beginning of modern scientific
research.</p>

<p>The greatest interest, however, which
Webster's vocabulary has for us is in its
justification of the title to his Dictionary.
It was an American Dictionary, and no one
who examines it attentively can fail to perceive
how unmistakably it grounds itself on
American use. Webster had had an American
education; he made his dictionary for
the American people, and as in orthography
and pronunciation he followed a usage
which was mainly American, in his words
and definitions he knew no authority beyond
the usage of his own country. Webster's
Dictionary of 1807 had already furnished
Pickering with a large number of words for
his vocabulary of supposed Americanisms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
and Webster had replied, defending the
words against the charge of corruption; the
Dictionary of 1828 would have supplied
many more of the same class. The Americanism,
as an English scholar of that day
would have judged it, was either in the word
itself or in some special application of it.
Webster, like many later writers, pointed
out that words which had their origin in
English local use had here simply become
of general service, owing to the freedom of
movement amongst the people and the constant
tendency toward uniformity of speech.
The subject has been carefully treated, and
it is unnecessary to consider it here. Enough
for us to remember that Webster was not
singling out words as Americanisms, but incorporating
in the general language all these
terms, and calling the record of entire product
an American Dictionary of the English
Language. The reader may be entertained
by a selection of these words and definitions,
taken somewhat at random from the
vast number of undiscriminated words in
the Dictionary, and containing often Webster's
rather angry championship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p><p>"Whittle, <i>v. t.</i> To pare, or cut off the
surface of a thing with a small knife. Some
persons have a habit of <i>whittling</i>, and are
rarely seen without a penknife in their
hands for that purpose. [<i>This is, I believe,
the only use of this word in New England.</i>]</p>

<p>"Tackle, <i>v. t.</i> To harness; as to tackle
a horse into a gig, sleigh, coach, or wagon.
[<i>A legitimate and common use of the word
in America.</i>] 2. To seize; to lay hold of;
as, a wrestler tackles his antagonist. This
is a common popular use of the word in
New England, though not elegant. But it
retains the primitive idea, to put on, to fall
or throw on." The former of these definitions
is followed in the latest Webster by
the brief parentheses [Prov. Eng. Colloq.
U. S.].</p>

<p>"Roiling, <i>ppr.</i> Rendering turbid; or exciting
the passion of anger. [<span class="smcap">Note:</span> This
word is as legitimate as any in the language.]</p>

<p>"Memorialist, <i>n.</i> One who writes a memorial.
<i>Spectator.</i> 2. One who presents
a memorial to a legislative or other body, or
to a person. <i>U. States.</i></p>

<p>"Emporium. A place of merchandize;
a town or city of trade; particularly, a city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
or town of extensive commerce, or in which
an extensive commerce centers, or to which
sellers and buyers resort from different
countries: such are London, Amsterdam,
and Hamburg. New York will be an emporium.</p>

<p>"Emptyings, <i>n.</i> The lees of beer, cider,
etc.</p>

<p>"Fall, <i>n.</i> The fall of the leaf; the season
when leaves fall from trees; the autumn.</p>

<p>"Avails, <i>n.</i>, <i>plu.</i> Profits or proceeds. It
is used in New England for the proceeds of
goods sold, or for rents, issues, or profits.</p>

<p>"Ball, <i>n.</i> An entertainment of dancing;
originally and peculiarly at the invitation
and expense of an individual; but the word
is used in America for a dance at the expense
of the attendant.</p>

<p>"Beadle. An officer in a university whose
chief business is to walk with a mace, before
the masters, in a public procession; or, as
in America, before the president, trustees,
faculty, and students of a college in a procession,
at public commencements.</p>

<p>"Commemoration, <i>n.</i> The act of calling
to remembrance, by some solemnity; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
act of honoring the memory of some person
or event, by solemn celebration. The feast
of shells at Plymouth, in Massachusetts, is
an annual commemoration of the first landing
of our ancestors in 1620.</p>

<p>"Calculate, <i>v. i.</i> To make a computation;
as, we calculate better for ourselves
than for others. In <i>popular use</i>, this word
is often equivalent to <i>intend</i> or <i>purpose</i>,
that is, to make arrangements and form a
plan; as, a man <i>calculates</i> to go a journey.
This use of the word springs from the practice
of <i>computing</i> or <i>estimating</i> the various
circumstances which concur to influence the
mind in forming its determinations.</p>

<p>"Shaver, <i>n.</i> A boy or young man. This
word is still in common use in New England.
It must be numbered among our original
words.</p>

<p>"Span, <i>n.</i> A <i>span of horses</i> consists of
two of nearly the same color, and otherwise
nearly alike, which are usually harnessed
side by side. The word signifies properly
the same as <i>yoke</i>, when applied to horned
cattle, from buckling or fastening together.
But in America, <i>span</i> always implies resemblance
in color at least; being an ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ject
of ambition with gentlemen and with
teamsters to unite two horses abreast that
are alike.</p>

<p>"Likely, <i>a.</i> Such as may be liked;
pleasing; as a <i>likely</i> man or woman. [This
use of <i>likely</i> is not obsolete as Johnson
affirms, nor is it vulgar. But the English
and their descendants in America differ in
the application. The English apply the
word to external appearance; and with
them <i>likely</i> is equivalent to <i>handsome</i>, <i>well-formed</i>,
as a <i>likely</i> man, a <i>likely</i> horse. In
America the word is usually applied to the
endowments of the mind, or to pleasing accomplishments.
With us a <i>likely</i> man is a
man of good character and talents, or of
good dispositions or accomplishments, that
render him pleasing or respectable.]</p>

<p>"Clever, <i>a.</i> In <i>New England</i>, good-natured,
possessing an agreeable mind or disposition.
In <i>Great Britain</i> this word is
applied to the body or its movements, in
its literal sense; in <i>America</i> it is applied
chiefly to the mind, temper, disposition. In
Great Britain a <i>clever man</i> is a dextrous
man, one who performs an act with skill or
address. In New England a <i>clever man</i> is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
a man of a pleasing, obliging disposition
and amiable manners, but often implying a
moderate share of talents.</p>

<p>"Raise, <i>v. t.</i> To cause to grow; to procure
to be produced, bred or propagated;
as, to raise wheat, barley, hops, etc.; to
<i>raise</i> horses, oxen, or sheep. <i>New England</i>.
[The English now use <i>grow</i> in regard to
crops; as, to <i>grow</i> wheat. This verb intransitive
has never been used in New England
in a transitive sense, until recently
some persons have adopted it from the English
books. We always use <i>raise</i>, but in
New England it is never applied to the
breeding of the human race, as it is in the
Southern States.]</p>

<p>"Realize, <i>v. t.</i> To bring into actual existence
and possession; to render tangible
or effective. He never <i>realized</i> much profit
from his trade or speculation.</p>

<p>"Locate, <i>v. t.</i>, 2. To select, survey, and
settle the bounds of a particular tract of
land; or to designate a portion of land by
limits; as, to <i>locate</i> a tract of a hundred
acres in a particular township. <i>U. States.</i>
3. To designate and determine the place
of; as, a committee was appointed to <i>locate</i>
a church or a court-house. <i>N. England.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rail, <i>n.</i>, 1. A cross beam fixed at the
ends in two upright posts. <i>Moxon</i>. [In
New England this is never called a <i>beam</i>;
pieces of timber of the proper size for rails
are called <i>scantling</i>.] 2. In the <i>United
States</i> a piece of timber cleft, hewed, or
sawed, rough or smooth, inserted in upright
posts for fencing. The common <i>rails</i>
among farmers are rough, being used as
they are split from the chestnut or other
trees. The <i>rails</i> used in fences of boards
or pickets round gentlemen's houses and
gardens are usually sawed scantling, and
often dressed with the plane. 4. A series
of posts connected with cross beams, by
which a place is inclosed. <i>Johnson.</i> In
New England we never call this series a
<i>rail</i>, but by the general term <i>railing</i>. In a
picket fence, the pales or pickets rise above
the rails; in a ballustrade, or fence resembling
it, the ballusters usually terminate
in the rails.</p>

<p>"Tallow, <i>n.</i> A sort of animal fat, particularly
that which is obtained from animals
of the sheep and ox kinds.... The
fat of swine we never call <i>tallow</i>, but <i>lard</i>
or <i>suet</i>. I see in English books, mention is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
made of the tallow of hogs, but in America
I never heard the word thus applied.</p>

<p>"Prairy, <i>n.</i> [Fr. <i>prairie</i>.] An extensive
tract of land, mostly level, destitute of trees,
and covered with tall, coarse grass. These
<i>prairies</i> are numerous in the United States,
west of the Alleghany Mountains, especially
between the Ohio, Mississippi, and
the great lakes.</p>

<p>"Widen, <i>v. t.</i> To make wide or wider;
to extend in breadth; as, to <i>widen</i> a field;
to <i>widen</i> a breach. [Note. In America,
females say, to <i>widen</i> a stocking.]</p>

<p>"Window, <i>n.</i> An opening in the wall
of a building for the admission of light, and
of air when necessary. This opening has a
frame on the sides, in which are set movable
sashes, containing panes of glass. In
the U. States the sashes are made to rise
and fall, for the admission or exclusion
of air. In France <i>windows</i> are shut with
frames or sashes that open and shut vertically,
like the leaves of a folding door.</p>

<p>"Chore, <i>n.</i> [Eng. <i>char.</i>] In America this
word denotes small work of a domestic kind,
as distinguished from the principal work of
the day. It is generally used in the plural,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
<i>chores</i>, which includes the daily or occasional
business of feeding cattle and other
animals, preparing fuel, sweeping the house,
cleaning furniture, etc. (See char.)"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From these examples one may gather
some notion of Webster's method of treating
words which were either exclusively
American, or had undergone some change
in meaning and use. He regards them all
not as departures from the English standard
of the day, but diversities from an older
use, like the English current forms, and it
was no disgrace in his eyes for a word to
be an Americanism, nor did it require apology
or defense of any kind. There are
indeed many words not to be found in Johnson,
of American origin, or at least of American
adoption, which he enters silently with
the belief that they have quite as fair a
claim to a place in his Dictionary as if they
had been used by Dryden or Addison. I
have already quoted the passage in his preface
relating to the illustrative quotations;
the promise made by Webster is faithfully
kept, and the diligent reader may garner
many of the brief thoughts of Mason, Smith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Barlow, and other American writers whose
light has now faded.</p>

<p>By all these means, by a certain contempt
of Great Britain, by constant reference to
American usage, by citations from American
authors, Webster made the title to his
Dictionary good in every part of it, while
by the exercise of individual caprice and of
a personal authority, which had grown out
of his long-continued and solitary labor,
he attached his own name to it. Both
names remain. The existing Dictionary is
"An American Dictionary of the English
Language," and bears indubitable evidence
of its application to American use, but it is
no longer the organ of an over-zealous patriotism.
It bears Noah Webster's name on the
title-page, but the work has been revised,
not out of all likeness to its original form,
but with a fullness and precision which, being
impossible to any one man, required the
co&ouml;peration of a company of scholars. His
original Preface to the edition of 1828 has
been preserved as a memento of his attitude
in the presence of his great work, but his
Introduction and Advertisement and Grammar
of the English Language have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
swept away, and their place supplied by
the maturer and more scholarly work of
Webster's successors.</p>

<p>It has been said by some nice critic, anxious
to be just before he was generous, that
the book commonly known as Webster's
Dictionary, sometimes, with a ponderous familiarity,
as The Unabridged, should more
properly be called The Webster Dictionary,
as indicating the fact that the original private
enterprise had, as it were, been transformed
into a joint stock company, which
might, out of courtesy, take the name of
the once founder but now merely honorary
member of the literary firm engaged in the
manufacture and arrangement of words.
Indeed, the name Webster has been associated
with such a vast number of dictionaries
of all sizes and weights, that it has
become to many a most impersonal term,
and we may almost expect in a few generations
to find the word "Webster" defined
in some revised edition of the Unabridged
as the colloquial word for a Dictionary.
The bright-eyed, bird-like looking gentleman
who faces the title-page of his Dictionary
may be undergoing some metempsychosis,
but the student of American literature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
will at any time have little difficulty in rescuing
his personality from unseemly transmigration,
and, by the aid of historical
glasses, may discover that the Dictionary
maker, far from being either the arid, bloodless
being which his work supposes, or
the reckless disturber of philological peace
which his enemies aver, was an exceedingly
vigilant, determined American school-master,
who had enormous faith in his country, and
an uncommon self-reliance, by which he
undertook single-handed a task which, once
done, prepared the way for lexigraphical
work far more thorough and satisfactory
than could have been possible without his
pioneer labor. Not only have the successive
Dictionaries which bear his name resulted
from his labor, but it is not unfair to
refer the other great lexicon begun and carried
out by one of his early assistants to the
impetus which he gave. Indeed, the commercial
success of the great American Dictionary
may reasonably have been taken as
a ground of confidence for the production of
the corresponding works of an encyclop&aelig;dic
and dictionary character which attest
the enterprise of American publishers and
the thoroughness of American scholars.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publication of "An American Dictionary"
in 1828 was followed by increased
activity on Dr. Webster's part. He was more
than ever ambitious to secure a standard,
especially in orthography, and he began the
arrangement of his various text-books in a
series which should constitute an imposing
phalanx, each supporting its neighbor. The
work of preparation, revision, and publication
occupied the rest of his life. The quarto
Dictionary in two volumes cost twenty dollars.
He provided soon an abridgment in
octavo, and a "Dictionary for Schools, the
Counting-House, and for Families in Moderate
Circumstances;" he was constantly
revising his most lucrative book, the "Elementary
Spelling-Book," and he issued new
editions of his "History of the United
States," his "Teacher," a supplement to the
"Elementary," his "Improved Grammar,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and he prepared a "Manual of Useful Studies."
All of these books had friends and
enemies, and one of the most energetic of
the latter, Lyman Cobb, published "a Critical
Review of the Orthography of Dr. Webster's
Series of Books for Systematick Instruction
in the English Language," which,
in spite of some injustice and much quibbling,
is a most searching and exhaustive
commentary on Webster's weaknesses. The
contest over Webster's Dictionary, however,
did not assume great proportions until after
the publication of Worcester's Dictionary,
which afforded Webster's opponents a flag
about which they could rally. The war of
the dictionaries occurred after Webster's
death, and it is not within the province of
this sketch to enter upon that military campaign.
Within Webster's own life-time a
revision of the Dictionary appeared in 1840-1841,
and he was at work upon a further
revision when he died in 1843.</p>

<p>Our study of Webster has easily led us
away from Webster's personal history, except
so far as this has illustrated social,
literary, and historical movements. There
are still living those who, as young men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
were associated with him in New Haven,
and these with his grandchildren, as well as
his only surviving daughter, bear a memory
of his person entirely distinct from its public
reputation. The resolute old man, working
at his lexicography to the last moment,
was for them also the tender-hearted head
of a family, coming out from his study to
hear the music he loved so well, joining in
the home life, making affectionate pilgrimages
to the old homestead in West Hartford,
and putting in a plea there for the preservation
of the old fruit trees and vines which
dated from his childhood. He was a sturdy,
upright man, with the courtesy of an old
Federalist, and his figure was a familiar one
in the streets of New Haven. It was there
that he died, May 28, 1843, in the eighty-fifth
year of his age, surrounded by his
family, and cheerful with the sense of a
full life and of Christian trust and expectation.</p>

<p>Noah Webster's name abides, connected
with the great work which he initiated, and
the monument will keep his name imperishable.
It never can be an uninteresting
study to the people how the man, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
name is a household word, wrought and
achieved; the solid expression of character,
which I have tried to outline, is worthy of
a fuller, more thorough treatment; and it
is to be hoped that the sturdy life of more
than three score years and ten, which he
lived, with its dreams, its discoveries, its
ventures, its toil, and its honest achievements
may some day be told with all the
minuteness which records, researches, and
reminiscences will permit. Yet I do not
believe the fullest account of Webster would
disclose any important traits not discovered
by the exhibition of such of his writings and
labors as we have included in this survey.
There was nothing concealed in his nature.
His vanity made him open, and his strong
self-reliance gave him a boldness of expression
which makes it possible for any student
to measure his aims.</p>

<p>The chief discovery yet to be made of
Webster, if any is possible, lies in the direction
of history. I do not suppose that if
the entire correspondence of Webster with
his contemporaries could be produced, we
should find him any more potent as a public
man than we have seen him to be; but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
more thorough comprehension of the forces
at work in the organization of national life
may yet enable us to see with greater distinctness
the degree of Webster's power
and function. The last result of historical
study is the determination of national
genius, and for that time and the slow
evolution of national character are requisite.
I am sure that the dignity of Webster's
position in our history is more intelligible
to-day than it was in his own time. I am
confident that the twentieth century will
give him a juster meed than we are giving
him to-day.</p>

<p>It was at once his fortune and his misfortune
to pass his life contemporaneously with
the birth and adolescence of a great nation,
and to feel the passion of the hour. There
is unquestionably a parochial sort of nationality
which it is easy to satirize. No one
could well set it out in stronger light than
Webster himself in those passages in the
preface to his Dictionary which I have already
quoted. He is judiciously silent concerning
the American poets of his time, being
careful, even,&mdash;most unkindest cut!&mdash;not
to commit himself to the support of Joel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Barlow's heroic verse; but he produces a
list of American prosaists, whom he places
back to back with their English fellows. He
has a proper sense of the importance of language
to a nation, and appears to be perplexed
by the implied question: If Englishmen
and Americans speak the same language,
how in the world are we to tell them
apart and keep them apart? Then again,
since there has been a revolution resulting
in governmental independence, what stands
in the way of a complete independence, so
that the spick and span new nation may go
to the language tailors and be dressed in a
new suit of parts of speech? "Let us seize
the present moment," he cries, "and establish
a national language as well as a national
government." Never was there such
a chance, he thinks, for clearing away the
rubbish which has accumulated for generations
in our clumsy, inelegant language.
Hand him the Bible which people have
foolishly regarded as a great conservator of
the English tongue, and he will give you a
new edition "purified from the numerous
errors." Knock off the useless appendages
to words which serve only to muffle simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
sounds. Innocent iconoclast, with his school-master
ferrule!</p>

<p>It is worth our while to make serious answer
to these serious propositions, since the
true aspect of native literature may thus be
disclosed. The Revolution, which so filled
Webster's eyes, was unquestionably a great
historic event by reason of its connection
with the formal institution of a new nation;
but the roots of our national life were not
then planted. They run back to the first
settlements and the first charters and agreements;
nor is the genesis of the nation to be
found there; sharp as are the beginnings of
our history on this continent, no student
could content himself with a conception of
our national life which took into account
only the events and conditions determined
by the people and the soil of America.
Even in actual relations between America
and Europe there never has been a time
when the Atlantic has not had an ebbing as
well as a flowing tide, and the instinct which
now sends us to the Old World on passionate
pilgrimages is a constituent part of our
national life, and not an unfilial sentiment.
In the minds of Webster and many others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
England was an unnatural parent, and the
spirit of anger, together with an elation at
success in the severing of governmental ties,
made them impatient of even a spiritual
connection. But the Revolution was an outward,
visible sign of an organic growth
which it accelerated, but did not produce;
and the patriotic outcries of the generation
were incoherent expressions of a profounder
life which had been growing, scarcely
heeded, until wakened by this event. The
centripetal force of nationality was at work,
and it is possible now, even from our near
station, to discover the conjunction of outward
circumstance and inward consciousness
which marks nationality as an established
fact. It was a weak conception of
nationality which was bounded by Webster's
definition; but his belief in his country
and his energetic action were, in reality,
constantly overpassing that conception.
In spite of the disposition to regard a written
constitution as the bottom fact, there
was the real, substantial, organic nation, and
that saved the paper nation from erasure,&mdash;a
fate which easily overtakes South American
republics. A nation which could im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>mediately
be placed in the world's museum,
duly ticketed and catalogued, with its distinct
manners, dress, language, and literature,&mdash;this
was a conception which resulted
logically from theories which held the nation
itself to be the creation of popular will
or historic accident; but a nation slowly
struggling against untoward outward circumstance
and inward dissension, collecting
by degrees its constituent members, forming
and reforming, plunging with rude strength
down dangerous ways, but nevertheless
growing into integral unity,&mdash;this has
been the historical result of the living forces
which were immanent in the country when
the nation was formally instituted.</p>

<p>Now there never has been a time from
Webster's day to this when Americans have
not believed and asserted that nationality
consisted mainly in independence, and
waxed impatient not merely of foreign control
and influence, but even of hereditary
influence: the temper which calls for American
characteristics in art and literature is
often scarcely less hostile to the past of
American history than to the present of European
civilization. It is a restless, uneasy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
spirit, goaded by self-consciousness. It finds
in nature an aid and abettor; it grows angry
at the disproportionate place which the
Cephissus, the Arno, the Seine, the Rhine,
and the Thames hold on the map of the
world's passion. We are all acquainted
with the typical American who added to his
name in the hotel book on the shores of
Lake Como, "What pygmy puddles these
are to the inland seas of tremendous and
eternal America!" But these are coarser,
more palpable signs of that uneasy consciousness
which frets at a continued dependence
on European culture.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Webster was right
when he set himself the task of Americanizing
the English language by a recourse to the
Spelling-Book. He succeeded very largely
in determining the form of words; but he
did more than this, while he failed in the
ambitious and preposterous task which he
set himself. He did more; by his shrewdness
and his ready perception of the popular
need he made elementary education possible
at once, and furnished the American
people with a key which moved easily in
the lock; he failed where he sought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
most, because language is not a toy or a patent
machine, which can be broken, thrown
aside at will, and replaced with a better
tool, ready-made from the lexicographer's
shop. He had no conception of the enormous
weight of the English language and
literature, when he undertook to shovel it
out of the path of American civilization.
The stars in their courses fought against
him. It is so still. We cannot dispense
with European culture, because we refuse
to separate ourselves from the mighty past,
which has settled there in forms of human
life unrepresented among us. We cannot
step out of the world's current, though it
looks sluggish beside our rushing stream,
because there is a spiritual demand in us
which cries louder than the thin voice of a
self-conscious national life. This demand
is profoundly at one with the deeper, holier
sense of national being which does not strut
upon the world's stage. The humility of a
great nation is in its reverence for its own
past, and, since that is incomplete, in its admiration
for whatever is noble and worthy
in other nations. It is out of this reverence
and humility and this self-respect that great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
works in literature and art grow, and not
out of the overweening sensitiveness which
makes one's nationality but a petty jealousy
of other people.</p>

<p>It is possible for us thus to discriminate
between a nationality which is a mere posture
and that which is a plain expression of
positive organic life. When we measure
the force of the latter we are compelled to
a finer analysis, and its illustrations are to
be sought in subtler manifestations. Webster
well exemplifies, by the very rudeness
of his mind, phases of Americanism which
may be traced in more delicate lines elsewhere.
There can be no doubt that self-reliance,
which was both the cause and the
effect of local self-government long practiced,
has been a powerful factor in American
life; that an indifference to the past
has often been only the obverse of an elastic
hope, a consciousness of destiny; that a fearlessness
and a spirit of adventure have been
invited by the large promises held out by
nature; that an expansiveness of mind, and
an alertness and facility in intellectual device,
have been encouraged by the flexile
condition of American society. All things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
have seemed possible to the ardent American,
and each has secretly said to himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
<span>"I ... had resolved to be<br /></span>
<span>The maker of my destiny."<br /></span>
</p>
</div></div>

<p>These elements of character have entered
into literature, the exponent of character;
and Webster, with his self-reliance, his indifference
to the past, his consciousness of
destiny, his courage and resolution and quick
fitting into his country's work, stands easily
as the first aggressive American in our literature.
In him we see roughly marked
what future critics will discern of men more
readily assigned a place in universal literature.
The Americanism of Hawthorne, for
example, differs from that of Webster in
quality rather than in essence. They were
both content with America and New England.
Hawthorne, with his shrug at old
buildings and his wish that all over two
hundred years of age should be burnt down,
was repeating Webster's contempt of the
musty halls of collegiate Cambridge; and
Hawthorne, Yankeeizing the Greek myths,
and finding all Rome but the background
for his Puritan maiden, was asserting that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
new discovery of Europe by America which
has ever since been going on, and was illustrated
by Webster's excursions in language
to bring back English variations from American
usage.</p>

<p>The ease with which Webster walked
about the Jericho of English lexicography,
blowing his trumpet of destruction, was an
American ease, born of a sense that America
was a continent and not a province. He
transferred the capital of literature from
London to Boston, or New York, or Hartford,&mdash;he
was indifferent so long as it was
in the United States. He thought Washington
as good an authority on spelling as
Dr. Johnson, and much better than King
George. He took the Bible as a book to
be used, not as a piece of antiquity to be
sheltered in a museum, and with an American
practicality set about making it more
serviceable in his own way. He foresaw
the vast crowds of American children; he
knew that the integrity of the country was
conditioned on the intelligibility of their
votes, and he turned his back on England
less with indifference to her than with an
absorption in his own country. He made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Speller which has sown votes and muskets;
he made alone a Dictionary, which has
grown, under the impulse he gave it, into
a national encyclop&aelig;dia, possessing an irresistible
momentum. Indeed, is not the very
existence of that book in its current form
a witness to the same Americanism which
Webster displayed, only now in a firmer,
finer, and more complex form?</p>

<p>In the high walks of scholarship, where
nationality would seem to be effaced, we
have had very recently a capital illustration
of the inevitable tendency of national traits
to seek expression. The Appendix to the
"Revised Version of the New Testament"
contains the variations proposed by the
American company from the text as otherwise
determined. There were in the English
company men of radical temperament
and of conservative; there were in the
American company like distinctions; nevertheless
the final separation between the
two companies is largely on this line, and
one can easily see how much sympathy,
Webster, for example, would have expressed
with the position which the American company
took, a position not of dissent but of
independent assertion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>The separation between England and
America which was so effectual in Webster's
conception, and thus determined much
of his thought, was really incipient and
not complete. The two countries are more
widely separate to-day than they were then,
while the outward signs of separation are
in many ways less conspicuous. The forces
of national life have been diverging, and the
resultant in character and literature is more
sure and ineffaceable.</p>

<p>It should be observed that the individualism
which characterizes American life was
more marked in the first years of the republic
than it is now. After we have reasoned
away all we will of a revolutionary
cataclysmal element in the separation of the
United States from the British Empire,
there still remains a sharp determination
of individual life, historically evident, and
very influential in the formation of national
character. In the earliest years the centripetal
force for union was barely superior to
the centrifugal force for state independence;
but the political thought which justified
state sovereignty had its logical issue in an
isolated individuality. Common sense and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
prudence, to be sure, are always defeating
logic; but the logical conception helps us to
understand tendencies, and it is not difficult
to see that the word independence, which
was on every one's lips at the close of the
last century, was not the sign of a political
thought only, but expressed the habit of
mind with which persons everywhere regarded
life in its varied relations. The
breaking up of old political connections not
only unsettled the social fabric, it affected
necessarily all the relations which the person
held to society; and it was only as a
profounder political unity disclosed itself in
the nation that each man put forth more
confidently his hand to his fellow. The
historian of the Union will not fail to observe
how with the growth of that Union
there began to spring up societies and corporations
of every kind, the interdependence
of the States extending itself to the
interdependence of all interests involved in
the State, and the whole fabric of society
feeling its web and woof grow firmer and
denser.</p>

<p>The career of Webster illustrates this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>truth. He worked alone, and his solitariness
was not wholly due to his idiosyncrasies.
It was in part the penalty paid by a student
of the time. The resolution and self-reliance
of an American were his, and so was the
individuality. That such enterprises are
not now conducted single-handed is owing
not to a lack of courage but to the greater
complexity of life, the more constant sense
of interdependence, the existence of greater
solidarity in intellectual pursuits. Webster
was unable to believe that a company of
scholars could ever be formed who should
carry forward a revision of the Bible, and
therefore he made the attempt himself. Individual
criticism has been abundant ever
since, but no one, however learned or popular,
has ever been able to impress his work
upon the community. The most carefully
organized body of scholars submits the results
of its ten years' conference to the votes
of the world. The history of Webster's
Dictionary is parallel with the growth of
national life out of individualism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
